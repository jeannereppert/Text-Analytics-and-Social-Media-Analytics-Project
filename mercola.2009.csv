Do your joints ache when a storm is coming? Do you feel like a walking, talking weather prediction station? You may be convinced your arthritic pain is worse when the barometric pressure falls, but many researchers have developed headaches trying to prove this with science.
The vast majority of studies have failed to establish a scientific connection between changing weather patterns and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.
Despite its lack of scientific support, both arthritis sufferers and rheumatologists insist there is a great deal of clinical support for this phenomenon, citing widespread reports of weather-induced pain flare-ups.
More than 60 percent of osteoarthritis patients report that their symptoms vary with weather conditions.1 Fibromyalgia patients have also reported weather-related fluctuations in pain although, as with arthritis, scientific evidence is elusive.2, 3
Well, clinicians and patients may now be vindicated! A few recent scientific studies have begun to offer some ""mild support"" for what patients and physicians have reported for decades—weather may indeed be a factor in arthritis pain.

The video above will provide you with a first hand account of a remarkable success story.  Sarah Allen, a former patient of mine, shares how she put her arthritis into remission.  I encourage you to take the time to listen to her story and share it with your loved ones who may find it beneficial. 
Weather May Influence Arthritis Symptoms After All
Dutch researchers tracked pain levels of hip osteoarthritis sufferers over the course of two years, and then went back and matched their symptoms against daily weather records.
They found that the participants' aches and pains indeed were a little bit worse and joints a bit stiffer when humidity and barometric pressure levels rose, although the changes were certainly not dramatic.4
Pain scores worsened by one point for each 10 percent increase in humidity. Function scores worsened by one point for each 10 hectopascals (0.29 of an inch) increase in barometric pressure.
These changes were too small to be considered ""clinically relevant,"" but this doesn't mean that the pain was not real. Other recent European studies have shown similar findings, but the changes are all subtle; maybe this is the reason science has failed to demonstrate this connection until now.
How Can Atmospheric Pressure Cause Joint Pain?
Dr. Fotios Koumpouras, the rheumatologist interviewed in the featured video, mentions another recent European study finding a connection between temperature, barometric pressure, and joint pain.
He theorizes that, as barometric pressure falls (like before and during a storm), the pressure inside your joints changes, which may impact your nerve endings around those joints:5
""The ligaments contain these very specialized receptors, and they are stretch receptors. These stretch receptors, particularly in joints that may have arthritis, could be hypersensitive. And small changes in pressure, atmospheric pressure, may in fact allow these receptors to fire.""
Even small changes in pressure may cause these receptors to fire, which you may experience as an increase in pain. However, this is not the only theory in circulation.
Mood and daily activity may also be factors. It's possible that your pain threshold drops during cold, rainy weather, because environmental conditions can definitely affect your mood. When it's cold, many people are less likely to go outside and get the exercise that normally keeps arthritis pain in check.6
Another factor could be the placebo effect (or ""nocebo"" effect7). That is, if you expect your pain to be worse when the weather changes, then it very well may be. After all, the pain-weather ""phenomenon"" is commonly accepted as truth, at least in Western culture.
The Weather Channel even provides a map called ""Aches and Pains Index"" to forecast how severe your pain should be on any given day.8 (If you are a highly suggestible person, perhaps you should avoid going there!)
Now that we've spent some time mucking around in the gray areas of science with respect to arthritis pain, let's take a look at what we KNOW works in terms of pain relief for arthritis sufferers.
Two Kinds of Arthritis—and Both Can Be Painful
There are two types of arthritis: osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The only thing they have in common is that they are both characterized by pain, inflammation, stiffness, and swelling of the joints—but they are very different diseases, with different causes and presentations.
Here are the principal differences:
Osteoarthritis (OA): OA, or degenerative arthritis (degenerative joint disease), typically occurs in older individuals, but can also follow repetitive stress or acute trauma.
OA usually affects the distal joints, or the joints at the end of your fingers and toes, not the middle ones. Additionally, OA is not symmetrical, so typically you may have it in just one joint, or on one hand or foot but not the other.
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Much more serious than OA, RA is an autoimmune disease that causes your immune system to attack the tissues that line your joints. RA can occur at any age, but fortunately, juvenile RA is relatively rare.
RA tends to be bilateral and symmetrical. RA also affects your middle joints and is associated with joint deformities, especially your hands and fingers. People do die from RA so it's not to be treated lightly.9
Arthritis Drugs Are Some of the Most Dangerous in Medicine
Due to the fact that both OA and RA involve joint pain and inflammation, they share common treatment modalities. Anti-inflammatory drug approaches such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) and analgesics, like Tylenol, are typically used for both types of arthritis.
The problem with these drug approaches is that regular, chronic use of arthritis drugs can result in liver or kidney damage. Use of analgesics is a very common cause of kidney disease in the United States (analgesic nephropathy).
Acetaminophen is actually the No.1 cause of acute liver failure! Still, pain control is an important aspect of treating RA. Because of its severity, rheumatoid arthritis is often treated aggressively with some of the most dangerous drugs on the market.
A relatively recent class of RA drugs are the TNF-alpha inhibitors, also termed ""biologic"" drugs. While these drugs are enthusiastically promoted by the medical and pharmaceutical industry, there are still concerns about their safety. Potentially serious side effects include infection and cancer. A safety analysis was performed on three TNF-alpha inhibitors: Humira, Enbrel, and Remicade.
It was concluded that, when it comes to your significant risk of death from taking them, there is no difference among the three; they're all equally dangerous.
Arthritis pain can be quite severe and typically, most benefit from some form of pharmacologic relief while waiting for the natural therapies to kick in. So if you chose to use a drug, you'll want to be sure to use the safest drugs and only when necessary, with the ultimate goal of managing your pain without medications. Some of the safest pain drugs are the non-acetylated salicylates, such as salsalate, sodium salicylate, and magnesium salicylate (i.e. Salflex, Disalcid, or Trilisate).
Not only do pharmaceutical agents have a range of potential side effects, but they merely suppress symptoms without doing anything to address the underlying cause. Targeting the cause of the problem is a much more effective approach for achieving long-lasting relief.
Therefore, the remainder of this article will focus on treating arthritis effectively with ""tried and true"" natural approaches that are scientifically sound and that address the cause of the problem, with special emphasis on the management of RA.
First, Address Your Diet
Total Video Length: 25:35
Rheumatoid arthritis affects 1.5 million Americans. The majority are women, and the prevalence in women appears to be on the rise. I have personally treated more than 3,000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in my practice, which is well over 10 times the number a typical family physician would treat in his or her entire career—so I have a fair amount of experience here.
My rheumatoid arthritis treatment protocol has helped thousands of RA patients go into remission, and one of the key factors is dietary modification.
I cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of this aspect of the program—it is an essential component of my RA protocol. Following these general guidelines alone will go a long way toward dramatically reducing your chronic inflammation, whether it's from RA or another inflammation-based disease:
Eliminate sugar/fructose and most grains (this automatically means avoiding virtually all processed foods)
Optimize your gut flora by consuming naturally fermented vegetables; work your way up to 4 to 6 ounces per day of fermented veggies
Consume whole, unprocessed high-quality foods, organic and locally-grown if possible
Eat a large portion of your food raw
Get plenty of high-quality animal-based omega-3 fats, such as krill oil
Key Elements of My RA Treatment Protocol
For many years, I followed the Brown Protocol, originally developed by rheumatologist Thomas Brown. Over the years, I have modified his program, making changes to it based on new information provided by modern science, as well as my experience in natural medicine. Using this approach, 60 to 90 percent of my patients experienced improvement. You can review my complete RA treatment protocol here, but I have outlined many key components in the table that follows:
Key Components of My RA Treatment Protocol
Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN)
Naltrexone is a pharmacologically active opioid antagonist, conventionally used to treat drug and alcohol addiction.
However, in very small doses, it is inexpensive, non-toxic, and has immunomodulating properties widely reported by physicians as effective in getting people off of dangerous arthritis medications
Astaxanthin
A powerful anti-inflammatory antioxidant with very powerful pain control properties.
In one study, RA sufferers experienced a 35 percent improvement in pain levels, as well as a 40 percent improvement in their ability to perform daily activities, after only eight weeks on astaxanthin.
Astaxanthin at 4 mg per day is particularly useful for anyone placed on prednisone because it offers potent protection against cataracts and age-related macular degeneration.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D deficiency is strongly associated with the development of RA. Ideally, you'll want to get regular and appropriate sun exposure (alternatively take an oral D3 supplement) and closely monitor your levels to assure you maintain your level within the therapeutic range of 40-60 ng/ml year-round
Exercise
Regular exercise is critical if you want to prevent functional decline from arthritis. RA can lead to diminished muscle mass and reduced strength that can be as debilitating as the physical damage to your joints.
Just be careful not to overdo it, and take care with inflamed joints, icing them when necessary before and after exercise.
Your program should include a range of activities, including weight training, high intensity exercises, cardio, stretching, and core work.

Walking and swimming are also excellent (if you have access to a chlorine-free pool), as are practices like yoga and tai chi.
Drug-Free Relief from Pain and Inflammation
Curcumin (Turmeric)
Curcumin has been shown to be effective against acute and chronic pain and is best known for its potent anti-inflammatory properties; inhibits inflammatory enzymes and blocks inflammation pathways; shown to influence more than 700 genes
Boswellia
Also known as boswellin or ""Indian frankincense,"" boswellia is another herb I've found to be particularly useful against arthritic pain and inflammation
Ginger
Exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and can offer pain relief. Fresh ginger works well steeped in boiling water as a tea or grated into vegetable juice
EFT
Lingering emotional trauma is pervasive in people with RA. One of my favorite tools for addressing this is EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique), which has been described as ""acupuncture without needles.""
Although EFT is something you can learn to do yourself in the comfort of your own home, you may want to employ the help of a well-trained professional
Final Thoughts
If you have OA or RA, implementing some basic lifestyle changes can help quell the inflammation that causes your joints to become achy, stiff, or swollen. Whether you're an arthritis sufferer whose pain and stiffness fluctuates with the season or among the bunch who must manage troublesome symptoms 365 days a year, the guidelines I've shared have a very good chance of helping you to feel better. I know this because I've treated thousands of arthritis sufferers, just like you!
Drugs for rheumatoid arthritis are among the most dangerous drugs prescribed and may cause more problems than they solve, so the sooner you can incorporate more natural treatments and reduce your reliance on pharmaceuticals, the better. If you need to take an analgesic from time to time, this is much less risky than taking them on a daily basis. And in time, you may improve so much that you will completely leave them behind!"

Local schools can make hundreds of thousands of dollars from leases on towers.

But some parents say the money isn't worth it. They say the practice is irresponsible and gambling with students' health without conclusive evidence that towers are safe.

More than 262 million wireless subscribers in the U.S. depend on 120,000 towers to route their calls to the appropriate destination. In residential areas, schools are seen as prime locations for towers. They offer a large tract of land in an area that otherwise has smaller tracts and residential uses.

The debate over school-based towers is happening throughout the United States. In September, an Oregon district banned them on school grounds. Los Angeles Unified School District took a similar step in 2000."

But be careful -- not all of the probiotic-containing products found on store shelves provide the health benefits they claim.

Some regular foods contain healthy bacteria naturally, such as yogurt and naturally fermented pickles. But pasteurization has eliminated many of the probiotics that should be found in modern foods. The recent boom in probiotic products reflects an effort to re-introduce bacteria that promote good health.

When choosing a probiotic, look for products that list a specific strain of bacteria on their label, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG -- the final two letters identify the strain. A product that simply uses the first two names may include a similar, but not identical, bacterium that doesn't have the same scientific testing behind it. It’s best when the actual product -- not just the bacterium -- has been tested in humans. Don’t be afraid to do a bit of research, especially when a simple Web search can yield a lot of information.

Some additional tips: Look for the word ""live"" on the package, since organisms killed by processing won't be helpful. The expiration date may be particularly important, because even if a product still tastes good the bacteria may no longer be alive. For maximum benefit, try to consume a variety of different bacteria, as each may contribute something slightly different."

PLEASE NOTE: These are NOT my recommendations. I am merely posting them as an article that was published. My recommendations are below in my comment.
1. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy seeks to help people change how they think about things. Unlike more traditional forms of therapy, it focuses on “here and now” problems and difficulties. Numerous clinical studies throughout the world have consistently demonstrated that cognitive behavioral therapy is as effective as antidepressant medication. Within 20 sessions of individual therapy, approximately 75 percent of patients experience a significant decrease in their symptoms.
2. St John’s wort
St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) is commonly used for the treatment of depression. It is available in tablets, capsules and liquid form from supermarkets and health food shops. Research suggests that it exerts its antidepressant action by inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Numerous double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have examined the effectiveness of St. John’s wort for the treatment of mild to moderate major depression, and most have found the herb more effective than a placebo. It can be at least as effective as paroxetine (Paxil) in the treatment of moderate to severe depression in the short term.
3. S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe)
SAMe is an amino acid derivative that occurs naturally in all cells. It plays a role in many biological reactions by transferring its methyl group to DNA, proteins, phospholipids and biogenic amines. Several scientific studies indicate that SAMe may be useful in the treatment of depression.
4. Light Therapy
For years, light therapy has been used to treat seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression caused by short winter days and extended darkness. A lack of exposure to sunlight is responsible for the secretion of the hormone melatonin, which can trigger a dispirited mood and a lethargic condition. Light therapy helps to regulate the body’s internal clock in the same way that sunlight does. Light therapy is an effective treatment for seasonal affective disorder, and it may reduce the symptoms of non-seasonal depression as well.
5. Exercise
Researchers have found that regular exercise, and the increase in physical fitness that results, alters serotonin levels in the brain and leads to improved mood and feelings of wellbeing. Study after study has shown that exercise promotes mental health and reduces symptoms of depression. The antidepressant effect of regular physical exercise is comparable to potent antidepressants like Sertraline.
6. 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)
5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and tryptophan are also natural alternatives to traditional antidepressants. When your body sets about manufacturing serotonin, it first makes 5-HTP. Taking 5-HTP as a supplement may raise serotonin levels. The evidence suggests 5-HTP and tryptophan are better than a placebo at alleviating depression.
7. Massage
One of the best-known benefits of massage therapy is its ability to enhance feelings of well-being. Massage produces chemical changes in the brain that result in a feeling of relaxation and calm. It also reduces levels of stress hormones. Massage therapy lowers levels of stress hormone cortisol by an average of 30 percent. Massage also increases serotonin and dopamine, neurotransmitters that help reduce depression.
8. Acupuncture
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese treatment in which needles are inserted at specific points in the body. Research suggests that acupuncture can decrease or eliminate the symptoms of depression. A review of 8 controlled trials supported the theory that acupuncture can significantly reduce the severity of depression.
9. Yoga & Meditation
Yoga is an ancient system of relaxation, exercise, and healing with origins in Indian philosophy. Practicing yoga can alter your brain chemistry. Some yoga positions are effective in stimulating the release of endorphins and reducing the level of stress hormone cortisol. Several human studies support the use of yoga for depression, and yoga postures have been specifically shown to increase levels of the neurotransmitter GABA, which may alleviate depression.
10. B Vitamins
B vitamins play a role in the production of certain neurotransmitters, which are important in regulating mood and other brain functions. Folic acid deficiency has been noted among people with depression. Vitamin B6, or pyridoxine, is the cofactor for enzymes that convert L-tryptophan to serotonin, so vitamin B6 deficiency might result in depression. And there is some evidence that people with depression respond better to treatment if they have higher levels of vitamin B12."

A new study advocates a nationwide shift in autism research to focus on environmental factors such as pesticides, viruses and chemicals in household products.

Throughout the U.S., the numbers of autistic children have increased dramatically over the past 15 years. More than 3,000 new cases of autism were reported in California in 2006, compared with 205 in 1990.

Many medical officials argued that the rise was due to changes in diagnoses or migration patterns rather than a real rise in the disorder. But the new study concludes that those factors cannot explain most of the increase in autism.

Researchers analyzed 17 years of state data that tracks developmental disabilities. Migration to the state had no effect, and changes in how and when doctors diagnose the disorder can explain less than half of the increase.

It is possible that a pregnant woman's exposure to chemical pollutants, particularly metals and pesticides, could be altering a developing baby's brain structure, triggering autism. Many parent groups also believe that childhood vaccines could be responsible."

1. Don’t overdose on sugar
Your brain, which accounts for 2 percent of your body weight, sucks down roughly 20 percent of your daily calories. It demands a constant supply of glucose. But this doesn’t mean that you should slurp soda to keep your brain functioning optimally. In fact, high glucose levels slowly but surely damage cells everywhere in your body, including those in your brain.
2. Become a grazer
To optimize brain power, one tactic might be more frequent but smaller meals. Your brain works best with about 25 grams of glucose circulating in your blood stream -- about the amount found in a banana.
3. Eat foods that don’t raise blood glucose levels
Pretzels cause blood sugar to rise very quickly. Raw carrots, however, do not. High fiber carbohydrates raise blood glucose levels relatively slowly, and combining them with fat or protein can slow absorption even more. The key is a balanced diet, where all macronutrients -- carbohydrates, fats and proteins -- are given their due.
4. Know your fats
Not all fats are equal. Trans fats, common in fast food, are the worst. However, your brain is 60 percent fat, and very low levels of cholesterol have been associated with depression, aggression and anti-social behavior. Essential fatty acids, such as omega-3s, are proving valuable in treating depression and other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, as well as benefiting infant brain development.
5. Know yourself
Food affects everyone's brain a little differently. Listen to your body, and find out what choices are right for you."

Some scientists and researchers have devoted their entire lives to learning how the brain works. Here are some facts about your brain.

Physical Attributes

The weight of your brain is about 3 pounds.

Your skin weighs twice as much as your brain.

Your brain is made up of about 75 percent water.

Your brain consists of about 100 billion neurons.

There are anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 synapses for each neuron.

There are no pain receptors in your brain, so your brain can feel no pain.

There are 100,000 miles of blood vessels in your brain.

Your brain is the fattest organ in your body and may consist of at least 60 percent fat.

The Developing Brain

At birth, your brain was almost the same size as an adult brain and contained most of the brain cells for your whole life.

A newborn baby’s brain grows about three times its size in the first year.

Humans continue to make new neurons throughout life in response to mental activity.

The first sense to develop while in utero is the sense of touch. The lips and cheeks can experience touch at about 8 weeks and the rest of the body around 12 weeks.

Brain Function

Your brain uses 20 percent of the total oxygen in your body.

If your brain loses blood for 8 to 10 seconds, you will lose consciousness.

While awake, your brain generates between 10 and 23 watts of power -- or enough energy to power a light bulb.

The old adage of humans only using 10% of their brain is not true. Every part of the brain has a known function.

The brain can live for 4 to 6 minutes without oxygen, and then it begins to die. No oxygen for 5 to 10 minutes will result in permanent brain damage.

A study of 1 million students in New York showed that students who ate lunches that did not include artificial flavors, preservatives, and dyes did 14 percent better on IQ tests than students who ate lunches with these additives.

Psychology of Your Brain

You can’t tickle yourself because your brain distinguishes between unexpected external touch and your own touch.

There is a class of people known as supertasters who not only have more taste buds on their tongue, but whose brain is more sensitive to the tastes of foods and drinks. In fact, they can detect some flavors that others cannot.

The connection between body and mind is a strong one. One estimate is that between 50-70 percent of visits to the doctor for physical ailments are attributed to psychological factors.

Memory

Every time you recall a memory or have a new thought, you are creating a new connection in your brain.

Memories triggered by scent have a stronger emotional connection, and therefore appear more intense than other memory triggers.

While you sleep at night may be the best time for your brain to consolidate all your memories from the day. Lack of sleep may actually hurt your ability to create new memories.

Dreams and Sleep

Most people dream about 1-2 hours a night and have an average of 4-7 dreams each night.

Studies show that brain waves are more active while dreaming than when you are awake.

Some people (about 12 percent) dream only in black and white while others dream in color.

While you sleep, your body produces a hormone that may prevent you from acting out your dreams, leaving you virtually paralyzed."

The Hill criteria look at:

1. Strength of association
2. Consistency (repeated observation)
3. Specificity (one agent, one result)
4. Temporality (exposure precedes effect)
5. Biological gradient (dose-response relation)

6. Plausibility (e.g., mechanisms)
7. Coherency (no serious conflict with the generally known facts of the natural history and biology of the disease)
8. Experimental verification (randomized, controlled trial)
9. Analogy with other causal relationships

The theory that solar ultraviolet radiation -- and by extension, vitamin D, which is produced when such radiation strikes your skin -- is a potent cancer fighter satisfies most, if not all, of the criteria. From a scientific point of view, therefore, vitamin D reduces the risk of many forms of cancer and increases survival rates once cancer reaches a detectable stage.

However, public policy often lags behind scientific research. It is to be hoped that the acceptance of the beneficial nature of vitamin D in reducing the risk of cancer and many other diseases will not have too much longer to wait. It is encouraging that the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine is currently embarking on a two-year study of vitamin D, and is expected to issue a report in 2010.

Scientists in the UC Santa Barbara laboratories of Leslie Wilson, professor of biochemistry and pharmacology, and Mary Ann Jordan, adjunct professor in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, have shown how the healing power of these vegetables works at the cellular level. Their research is published in this month's journal Carcinogenesis.
""Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women, can be protected against by eating cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and near relatives of cabbage such as broccoli and cauliflower,"" said first author Olga Azarenko, who is a graduate student at UCSB. ""These vegetables contain compounds called isothiocyanates which we believe to be responsible for the cancer-preventive and anti-carcinogenic activities in these vegetables. Broccoli and broccoli sprouts have the highest amount of the isothiocyanates.
""Our paper focuses on the anti-cancer activity of one of these compounds, called sulforaphane, or SFN,"" Azarenko added. ""It has already been shown to reduce the incidence and rate of chemically induced mammary tumors in animals. It inhibits the growth of cultured human breast cancer cells, leading to cell death."""

And if you do, should you push yourself as hard as ever or take it easy? Will exercise have no effect, or make you feel better or worse?

Two little-known studies that were published a decade ago in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise showed results so much in favor of exercise that the researchers themselves were surprised.
The investigators found no difference in symptoms between those who exercised and those who rested. And there was no difference in the time it took to recover from the colds. But when the exercisers assessed their symptoms, people said they felt O.K. and, in some cases, they actually felt better.
Now, Dr. Leonard Kaminsky, an exercise physiologist at Ball State University, and others at Ball State encourage people to exercise when they have colds, at least if they have the type producing symptoms like runny noses and sneezing.

He is more cautious about other types of colds that produce fevers or symptoms below the neck such as chest congestion. Exercising with a head cold is not an issue for athletes, Dr. Kaminsky said, because most of them want to train no matter what. “If anything they tend to push too much,” he said."

Beer is more effective than wine at lowering the cancer-forming chemicals (and also apparently often makes for a better-looking and tastier meal.)

Cooking food increases its levels of chemical compounds called heterocyclic amines (HA’s), which can cause cancerous tumors. Frying and grilling meat is particularly dangerous, because the intense heat turns sugars and amino acids into high levels of the compounds.

However, scientists are gathering increasing amounts of evidence to show that the levels of HA’s in cooked meat can be lowered by treating the food beforehand. Marinating steak in red wine or beer for six hours before frying can cut levels of two types of HA by up to 90 percent compared. Beer was also efficient at reducing a third type of HA, cutting levels significantly in just four hours.

Previous research has shown that a red wine marinade has a similar effect on HA levels in fried chicken. A sauce made of olive oil, lemon juice and garlic can also lower HA levels in grilled chicken by as much as 90 percent.

Cooking meat on lower heat and for a shorter period of time also prevents dangerous levels of HA’s from forming."

Scientists have previously reported cases of blindsight in people with partial damage to their visual lobes. This new report is the first to show it in a person whose visual lobes — one in each hemisphere, under the skull at the back of the head — were completely destroyed. The finding suggests that people with similar injuries may be able to recover some crude visual sense with practice.
“It’s a very rigorously done report and the first demonstration of this in someone with apparent total absence of a striate cortex, the visual processing region,” said Dr. Richard Held, an emeritus professor of cognitive and brain science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Scientists have long known that the brain digests what comes through the eyes using two sets of circuits. Cells in the retina project not only to the visual cortex, but also to subcortical areas. These include the superior colliculus, which is crucial in eye movements and may have other sensory functions; and, probably, circuits running through the amygdala, which registers emotion.
In an earlier experiment, one of the authors of the new paper, Dr. Alan Pegna of Geneva University Hospitals, found that the same patient had emotional blindsight.

When presented with images of fearful faces, he cringed subconsciously in the same way that almost everyone does, even though he could not consciously see the faces. The subcortical, primitive visual system apparently registers not only solid objects but also strong social signals."

The historically unappreciated taste is produced by two interacting sets of molecules, each of which is needed to trigger cellular receptors on your tongue's surface.

""This opens the door to designing better, more potent and more selective umami enhancers,"" said Xiaodong Li, a chemist at San Diego-based food-additive company Senomyx.

Four other basic tastes -- bitter, sweet, salty and sour -- were identified 2,400 years ago by the Greek philosopher Democritus, and became central to the western gastronomic canon.

In the late 19th century, French chef and veal-stock inventor Auguste Escoffier suggested that a fifth taste was responsible for his mouth-watering brew. Though Escoffier's dishes were popular, his theories were dismissed until 1908, when Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda showed that an amino acid called glutamate underlies the taste of a hearty variety of seaweed soup.

In honor of Ikeda, the taste was dubbed umami, the Japanese word for delicious. It took another 80 years for umami to be recognized by science as comparable to the other four tastes.

In the meantime, monosodium glutamate became wildly popular as a flavor enhancer. But MSG can cause headaches and dizziness, and has been tenuously linked to long-term neurological disorders.

""The only way to have a substitute is to find the molecular target of glutamate. If we figure that out, then we can screen for agents that are not glutamate but could mimic it,"" said Johns Hopkins University neuroscientist Solomon Snyder, who was not involved in the new study.

Li's team have taken human kidney cells and added the genes for receptors linked to umami taste. Receptors form on the cells' surface, geometrically resembling the mouth of a Venus flytrap. When glutamate is caught on a receptor's lips and a molecule called ribonucleotide lodged in its throat, the receptor snaps shut.

""The configuration of the receptor changes, sending a signal down into the cell,"" said Li. In their engineered and disconnected cells the signal quickly fizzled -- but in a tongue surface cell, said Li, ""Your brain gets a signal: Something tastes good that is in my mouth."""

The findings provide important clues to how to develop a safe, effective vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the main cause of wintertime hospital stays among babies and young children worldwide, Dr. Fernando P. Polack, the lead researcher on the study, told Reuters Health.
""A big concern for the scientists involved in RSV vaccine development is to make sure we do not repeat the same situation again,"" said Polack, who is also affiliated with the INFANT Foundation in Buenos Aires.
In the late 1960s, children in Washington, DC received an RSV vaccine in which the virus was inactivated with formalin. Eighty percent of the children given the shot were hospitalized with severe respiratory disease, and two died.

Many scientists had thought the formalin was responsible for the vaccine's problems, but the chemical has been used safely in other vaccines.
For eight years, Polack and his team have been investigating why the vaccine caused the illness, known as enhanced respiratory disease, or ERD.

The problem, they report this month in the journal Nature Medicine, was that the children's antibodies were not binding strongly enough to the inactivated virus to produce a protective immune response. Instead, the antibodies were dragging the dead virus with them, triggering a massive attack by other arms of the immune system.
The inactivated vaccine was only weakly stimulating molecules on the surfaces of cells that are responsible for recognizing infectious invaders and triggering an appropriate immune response, the researchers say. So an effective vaccine would need to do a better job of stimulating these molecules, known as Toll-like receptors, Polack explained.
Most likely, the researcher said, making an effective and safe RSV vaccine will require developing an attenuated form of the virus, meaning a strain that is too weak to cause infection but active enough to stimulate the Toll-like receptors adequately."

While many agree that ecological agriculture is desirable from an environmental and social point of view, there remain fears that ecological and organic agriculture produce low yields.

Below is a summary by Lim Li Ching, a researcher with Third World Network, of the available evidence to demystify the productivity debate and demonstrate that ecological agriculture is indeed productive, especially so in developing countries.

A recent study examined a global dataset of 293 examples and estimated the average yield ratio (organic : non-organic) of different food categories for the developed and developing world (Badgley et al., 2007). For most of the food categories examined, they found that the average yield ratio was slightly less than 1.0 for studies in the developed world, but more than 1.0 for studies in developing countries.

On average, in developed countries, organic systems produce 92% of the yield produced by conventional agriculture. In developing countries, however, organic systems produce 80% more than conventional farms.

With the average yield ratios, the researchers then modeled the global food supply that could be grown organically on the current agricultural land base. They found that organic methods could hypothetically produce enough food on a global per capita basis to sustain the current human population, and potentially an even larger population, without putting more farmland into production.

Moreover, contrary to fears that there are insufficient quantities of organically acceptable fertilizers, the data suggest that leguminous cover crops could fix enough nitrogen to replace the amount of synthetic fertilizer currently in use.

This model suggests that organic agriculture could potentially provide enough food globally, but without the negative environmental impacts of conventional agriculture.

In front of us are two teaspoons and a brown glass bottle. Shchepinov opens the bottle, pours out a teaspoon of clear liquid and drinks it down. He smiles. It's my turn.
I put a spoonful of the liquid in my mouth and swallow. It tastes slightly sweet, which is a surprise. I was expecting it to be exactly like water since that, in fact, is what it is - heavy water to be precise, chemical formula D2O. The D stands for deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen with an atomic mass of 2 instead of 1. Deuterium is what puts the heavy in heavy water. An ice cube made out of it would sink in normal water.
My sip of heavy water is the culmination of a long journey trying to get to the bottom of a remarkable claim that Shchepinov first made around 18 months ago. He believes he has discovered an elixir of youth, a way to drink (or more likely eat) your way to a longer life.
Many anti-aging medications are based on supplementing your body's own defenses with antioxidant compounds such as vitamin C and beta-carotene, though there is scant evidence that this does any good.

Shchepinov realized there was another way to defeat free radicals. While he was familiarizing himself with research on aging, his day job involved a well-established - if slightly obscure - bit of chemistry called the isotope effect. On Christmas day 2006, it dawned on him that putting the two together could lead to a new way of postponing the ravages of time.
The basic concept of the isotope effect is that the presence of heavy isotopes in a molecule can slow down its chemical reactions.
All of this is conventional chemistry: the isotope effect was discovered back in the 1930s and its mechanism explained in the 1940s. The effect has a long pedigree as a research tool in basic chemistry for probing the mechanisms of complex reactions.
Shchepinov, however, is the first researcher to link the effect with aging. It dawned on him that if aging is caused by free radicals trashing covalent bonds, and if those same bonds can be strengthened using the isotope effect, why not use it to make vulnerable biomolecules more resistant to attack? All you would have to do is judiciously place deuterium or carbon-13 in the bonds that are most vulnerable to attack, and chemistry should take care of the rest."

These results, while hardly thrilling, don't seem abysmal at first. Health gets more coverage than celebrities, after all, which seems like a victory in our current climate. But compounding the small amount of attention devoted to health, the breakdown within existing health coverage shows a tendency to focus on controversial or sensational aspects of health issues, leaving vital policy information behind.

Within the small percentage of health news, outlets focused 41.7 percent on specific diseases, 30.9 percent of public health issues, and 24.7 percent on actual health policy. This means that health policy news made up less than 1 percent of media coverage during the study’s time period."

We are getting all the bulk without the nutrients, plus adding to our propensity for developing real food cravings. So whether you are a vegetarian or an omnivore, you can start to reverse aging by simply choosing to eat the right foods to keep you full of vim, vigor, and vitality, especially over the holidays.
The easiest way to make sure you are getting more nutrients into every meal.

Every time you flavor your meals with herbs or spices you are literally ""upgrading"" your food without adding a single calorie. You are taking something ordinary and turning it into something extraordinary by adding color, flavor, vitamins, and often medicinal properties.

Here's why:
* Spices and herbs maximize nutrient density. Herbs and spices contain antioxidants, minerals and multivitamins. At the cocktail party, choose the Thai chicken satay stick over the tried and true fried chicken strip.

* Spices and herbs create a more thermogenic diet. Because spices are nutrient dense, they are thermogenic, which means they naturally increase your metabolism.

* Some spices and herbs increase your overall feeling of fullness and satiety, so you'll eat less. One study conducted at Maanstricht University in the Netherlands showed that when one consumes an appetizer with half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes before each meal, it decreased their calorie intake by 10-16 percent.

* Spices and herbs have real medicinal properties. Study after study shows the benefits of distinct herbs and spices. For example, one 2003 trial of 60 people with type 2 diabetes reported that consuming as little as two teaspoons of cinnamon daily for six weeks reduced blood-glucose levels significantly. It also improved blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, perhaps because insulin plays a key role in regulating fats in your body.

Choose flavor over blandness every time, and try to incorporate these specific herbs and spices into your diet if you have the following health concerns:
rosemary and basil for their anti-inflammatory power
cumin and sage for their dementia-fighting power
cayenne and cinnamon for their obesity-fighting power
coriander and cinnamon for their sugar regulating powers
lemon grass, nutmeg, bay leaves and saffron for their calming effects on your mood
turmeric for its cancer fighting power
oregano for its fungus-beating power
garlic, mustard seed and chicory for their heart-pumping power
basil and thyme for their skin-saving power
turmeric, basil, cinnamon, thyme, saffron, and ginger for their immune-boosting power
coriander, rosemary, cayenne, allspice and black pepper for their depression-busting power"

They are safer and have fewer side effects. Many of these can not only help you fall asleep and stay asleep, but they can also promote muscle relaxation.

Magnesium and calcium

Magnesium and calcium are both sleep boosters, and when taken together they become even more effective. Plus, by taking magnesium you cancel out any potential heart problems that might arise from taking calcium alone. Take 200 milligrams of magnesium (you can lower the dose if it causes diarrhea) and 600 milligrams of calcium each night.

Wild lettuce

If you've suffered anxiety, headaches, or muscle or joint pain, you might already be familiar with wild lettuce. It's also effective at calming restlessness and reducing anxiety, and may even quell restless legs syndrome. When using a wild-lettuce supplement, take 30 to 120 milligrams before bed.

Hops

Beer fans are already familiar with the calming effect of hops, the female flowers used in beer making. For sleep purposes, this extract has been widely used as a mild sedative for anxiety and insomnia. Take 30 to 120 milligrams before climbing under the covers.

Aromatherapy

Lavender is the trick here, as studies have proven that it aids in sleep. It's also an inexpensive, nontoxic way to slip into a peaceful slumber. Find a spray with real lavender and spritz it on your pillow before bedtime, or buy a lavender-filled pillow.

Melatonin

Melatonin is the hormone that controls sleep, so it's no wonder that it naturally induces sleep. Studies show that lower doses are more effective -- plus, there's concern that too-high doses could cause toxicity as well as raise the risk of depression or infertility.

Yoga and Meditation

Choose gentle yoga or stretching, not vigorous power or ashtanga yoga, which could energize you instead. Try easy yoga stretches in bed followed by simple meditation. Close your eyes and, for 5 to 10 minutes, pay attention to nothing but your breathing.

L-theanine

This amino acid comes from green tea, and not only helps maintain a calm alertness during the day but also a deeper sleep at night. However, green tea doesn't contain enough L-theanine to significantly boost your REM cycles, and might make you wake up to go to the bathroom. Instead, buy pure, active L-theanine (some brands have inactive forms of theanine that block the effectiveness), and take 50 to 200 milligrams at bedtime.

Valerian

Valerian is one of the most common sleep remedies for insomnia. Numerous studies have found that valerian improves deep sleep, speed of falling asleep, and overall quality of sleep. However, it's most effective when used over a longer period of time. Keep in mind that about 10 percent of the people who use it actually feel energized, which may keep them awake. If that happens to you, take valerian during the day. Otherwise, take 200 to 800 milligrams before bed."

In addition, the researchers also found that this minimal amount of exposure can lead to higher body fat among males. Although the study was in mice, the biological cause and effect described in the research paper likely applies to humans as well.
Researchers studied pregnant mice for 48 hours. Mice given caffeine produced embryos with a thinner layer of tissue separating some of the heart's chambers.
The researchers then examined the mice born from these groups to determine the long-term effects on the offspring. All of the adult males exposed to caffeine as fetuses had an increase in body fat of about 20 percent, and decrease in cardiac function of 35 percent."

According to the article linked below, this is the moral crux for American medicine. If Americans become healthier, there will be fewer jobs. Maybe this is why modern medicine drags its feet when it comes to preventive medicine.
The government is complicit in spawning the diabetes/obesity epidemic by subsidizing the production of non-nutrient-dense foods and high-fructose corn syrup. Statin anti-cholesterol drugs are approved by the FDA even though they don't reduce mortality rates. Modern medicine is an industry that wants more, not less, disease to treat. Doctors aren't interested in disease prevention -- conventional medicine is quick to dismiss any truly preventive therapies as unproven and requiring more study.
Still, an estimated 38 percent of U.S. adults, along with 12 percent of children, use some type of complementary and alternative medicine, according to a new U.S. government survey.
Complementary and alternative medicine refers to a wide-ranging collection of medical and health care systems, practices and products that aren't generally considered conventional medicine. They include herbal supplements, meditation, chiropractic treatment and acupuncture.
For the survey, more than 23,300 adults were interviewed about their use of complementary and alternative medicine. More than 9,400 were also asked about their children's use of complementary and alternative medicine.
The survey found that the use of techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, massage therapy, and yoga increased significantly. The most common supplements used by adults are omega 3 fats, glucosamine, echinacea, flaxseed, and ginseng.
Other findings from the survey showed that more women than men use complementary and alternative medicine (42.8 percent versus 33.5 percent). Older, more educated and wealthier adults also used complementary and alternative medicine in greater numbers.
It's no wonder that 38 percent of American adults have opted for alternative medicine. Where else can the public turn? Many patients are belittled when they tell their doctors they are taking dietary supplements instead of prescription drugs.
Americans are increasingly distrustful of prescription medicines. According to a 2005 poll, 35 percent of Americans who were prescribed drugs didn't take them because they wanted to save money, and another 28 percent didn't take them because of ""frightening side effects.
It is becoming increasingly clear that conventional medicine is working against the public welfare."

Researchers report that there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest that the drugs offer any additional benefit when used in conjunction with conventional preventative medications.
  LABAs, such as salmeterol and formoterol, can reduce the symptoms of asthma for periods of up to 12 hours. They are commonly given to relax the airways overnight or after exercise, and are recommended as add-on therapies to inhaled corticosteroids. But since LABAs have previously been shown to increase the risk of life-threatening adverse effects in adults when used as the only drug, they are not recommended as the main treatment agent in asthma in any age groups.

Now researchers say that their use does not generally provide any further benefit over regular ICS therapy for children. The overview included four previous reviews of trials in children above the age of four. They showed that LABAs did not reduce severity of asthma symptoms as measured by hospital admissions, or the need for steroid medication.
  If you want something that really works for asthma, you might want to look into vitamin D. One study has shown that poor diets and the lack of vitamin D among mothers were the two strongest determining factors in whether their children suffered from asthma -- more so even than whether or not the mothers smoked.

This suggests that some of the most dire predictions about a potential new pandemic could be exaggerated.
Scientists looked at the available information regarding the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed anywhere between 50 million and 100 million people globally in the space of about 18 months. Some research has shown that on average it took a week to 11 days for people to die, which fits in more with the known pattern of a bacterial infection than a viral infection.
People with influenza often get what is known as a ""superinfection"" with a bacterial agent. In 1918 it appears to have been Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Many projections for a new pandemic have been based on a worst-case 1918 scenario, in which tens of millions of people would die globally. However, since strep is much easier to treat than the flu using modern medicine, a new pandemic might be much less dire than it was in the early 20th century."

Passage of the bill into law would repeal a current federal regulation prohibiting raw milk and raw milk products for human consumption in interstate commerce. The bill would not force a state to legalize the sale of raw milk from local producers, nor would it force a state to allow the sale of raw milk from out-of-state producers in its retail stores.

Muscle problems are the best known of statin drugs' adverse side effects, but cognitive problems and pain or numbness in the extremities are also widely reported. A spectrum of other problems, ranging from blood glucose elevations to tendon problems, can also occur as side effects.
The paper summarizes powerful evidence that statin-induced injury to the function of the body's energy-producing cells, called mitochondria, underlies many of the adverse effects that occur to patients taking statin drugs. Statins lower levels of coenzyme Q10, a compound central to the processes of making energy within mitochondria and eliminating dangerous compounds called free radicals.

And much of the blame for the current American diet comes down to economics.

In a $10 trillion economy, $1 trillion goes to food companies and $2.5 trillion goes to health care. Food companies, like any good businesses, are always seeking to increase the consumption of their product. But in food, there’s an unwritten law of marketing called potato chip marketing equations.

That means that 10 percent of your customers buy 90 percent of the product. You may go out and buy one or two bags of potato chips a month. But somebody else is buying one bag a day -- 30 bags every month.

When you add that extra 20 percent extra to your weight, you don’t increase your food consumption 20 percent a day. You double it to 200 percent a day. Your caloric intake to maintain 180 pounds is almost twice the caloric intake you need to maintain 150 pounds.

Think of that from the standpoint a food company. Food companies, as a result, market to people to make everyone part of their potato chip marketing equation. They spend their marketing dollars getting existing customers to buy more of their product.

At what point after two, three, four, 10, 12 bags of potato chips do they no longer taste good? How about McDonald’s French fries? All processed foods never get tiring -- they have chemically altered the food substances in that food to make sure you’re never tired of it.

The problem with obesity, which is ultimately caused by poor diet, is really an economic problem. And when people consume this terrible diet, they end up with all types of medical problems, and they go to the doctors for treatment.

But the medical companies are in effect in a conspiracy of sorts with the food companies. They’ve almost said to the food companies, “We’ll treat the symptoms of this bad diet. We will never treat the cause, your bad food.”"

The FDA now admits that Americans are suffering and dying because the FDA does not have the scientific ability to ascertain if new drugs are safe or effective or to evaluate scientific claims.

These failures affect the health of all Americans. Good drugs are not approved or approved after interminable delays. Even after new drugs are shown to be safe, doctors cannot use them with terminally ill patients whose cases are otherwise hopeless. Bad drugs are approved -- often on the basis of a recommendation by panels whose members include drug company consultants.

The record with the food supply is almost as bad as with drugs. When fresh food turns out to be contaminated, the only solution the Agency can come up with is to ""nuke"" it with radiation. What does this do to food? The FDA certainly does not know.

The FDA pushes forward, approving faulty and dangerous drugs and medical devices by the thousands and approving toxic chemicals for use in baby formula, baby bottles, and prescription drugs. Meanwhile, the FDA pursues what can only be described as a harassment campaign against those who want to rely on wholesome foods, dietary supplements, and lifestyle changes to achieve natural good health.

A veritable revolution is taking place in the science of food, food extracts, and food supplements. Food producers would like to tell the American public about it. Millions of lives could be saved as a result. But the FDA will not permit it. The Agency ignores first amendment protections and censors the communication of valid scientific information.

The epidemics currently plaguing this country -- cancer, obesity, diabetes, asthma and allergies, and many other debilitating disorders -- are linked to manmade products and processes that the FDA has approved and promoted. These failures have resulted in the sickest generation in the history of this country. The agency seems to have lost sight of its mandate to protect the public and has instead come to see itself as the guardian of corporate interests. It is time to end the many conflicts of interest linking the FDA to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, conflicts of interest that betray the public and harm so many American consumers.

Many readers of my newsletter have written to ask why I don’t recommend ear candling.
The answer is simple. From all of my research it appears that ear candling doesn’t work as its proponents claim, and it actually has the potential to be quite dangerous.
There’s no scientific evidence that candling has any real benefits, but there are a significant number of reports of burn injuries caused by the procedure.
A Mysterious History
Although ear candling is thought to be an ancient practice, its origin is unclear.
Places and cultures as diverse as China, Egypt, the pre-Columbian Americas, Tibet, the mythical city of Atlantis, and even the Hopi Indian tribe have been mentioned as having originated the practice. No one seems to know for certain, The Hopi Tribal Council has publicly stated that the Hopi people do not and have never practiced ear candling.
How Candling is Performed
The ear candling procedure itself involves putting a hollow cone-shaped device or “candle,” typically made of linen or cotton soaked in wax or paraffin, in the ear canal, and lighting it on fire.
The person undergoing the procedure lies on his or her side. A paper plate or other collection device is placed above the ear, and the candle is inserted through a hole in the plate into the ear canal. The candle is lit, and trimmed as it burns down.
After the candle burns down and is removed from the ear, a cotton swab is used to clean visible wax from the ear, and oil is sometimes applied as a finishing touch.
What Advocates Claim
Proponents and practitioners of candling maintain the procedure removes wax and other impurities from the ear. The process by which this purportedly happens is as the smoke moves down the candle into your ear and back out again, a vacuum is created that pulls out wax and other debris from your ear into the hollow candle.
Some practitioners offer proof of the success of the procedure by putting the still-warm candle in a bowl of water, claiming everything that floats free -- that isn’t obviously candle wax -- is ear wax, dead skin, toxins, and other debris.
Some even go so far as to claim the debris is actually Candida (yeast).
Other practitioners will offer proof by opening up a just-burned candle, claiming that the residue left behind is ear wax and debris from the client’s ear.
Ear candling is advertised as being helpful for hearing loss, inner ear pain, and relief of tinnitus. Claims also include that candling cleanses your ear canal, cures ear aches, relieves “fluid buildup,” and alleviates sinus pressure.
Some advocates go even further by asserting the procedure “clears” your eyes, fortifies your central nervous system, releases blocked energy, and stabilizes emotions.
Why These Claims Do Not Appear to be Valid
Wax is sticky. The negative pressure required to force wax from your ear canal would need to be so powerful that it would rupture your eardrum in the process.
There is no vacuum effect created by smoke moving down the candle. Research published in the journal Laryngoscope measured this pressure and concluded that no negative pressure was created. The same research also revealed that no ear wax was removed during candling, and that candle wax was actually deposited in some test subjects’ ears.
Removal of debris from the ear is based on the claim that the eardrum is porous and allows impurities to pass through. This is just not true. The debris that appears inside the burned candle and/or in the collection device is nothing more than ashes from the wick and wax from the candle itself.
Playing With Fire
Not only is ear candling ineffective, it can be dangerous.
As mentioned in the Laryngoscope article linked above, a 1996 survey of 144 ear, nose and throat physicians found that 10 percent had seen patients with injuries resulting from ear candling. These injuries included external burns, ear canal obstruction with candle wax, and even a perforated eardrum.
Despite the significant risks involved with the procedure, many people who perform ear candling for profit have no medical background and do not use otoscopes in order to avoid the legalities of practicing medicine without a license.
For an in-depth, graphic account of the case of one woman with self-inflicted wounds caused by ear candling, read this article by Richard Harris, Ph.D., of Brigham Young University.
Why I Don’t Recommend Ear Candling
Aside from the fact that ear candling is a potentially dangerous practice with no proven benefits, even if candling could remove wax from the ear I would advise against it.
The wax in your ears provides a coating that protects your inner ear against water and dust. Ear wax, known in scientific terms as cerumen, is acidic and helps battle bacteria. It is also an anti-fungal.
Ear wax has been designed by nature as a cleaning mechanism for your ear. For most of us, the wax moves through the ear canal and eventually makes it to the outside, taking any dirt and other accumulated matter with it. Only ear wax that has reached the opening of your ear should be removed.
Says Benjamin Asher, chairman of the committee on alternative medicine for the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery:
""I'm open to a lot of complementary therapies, but I'm not at all impressed with this one.""
And according to Dr. David Leopold, director of integrative medical education at Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in San Diego:
“(At Scripps) we do integrative medicine. We’re always dealing with the ‘alternative’ world. … If it works and it’s safe we want it for our patients. But pretty definitely this is one you shouldn’t try. At the very best it’s not going to work. At the worst it’s going to be dangerous. … It’s not effective and people should stay away.”
How to Deal with a Chronic Ear Wax Problem
Frequently, the cause of excessive wax buildup is an omega-3 deficiency. If you’re not getting enough omega-3 fatty acids in your diet, I recommend supplementing with with a high quality source of animal based omega three oil like krill oil.

Ellie was born missing a fraction of her small intestine and some of her colon.

Two and a half years later, Ellie is one of more than 100 children with ""short bowel syndrome"" who have received a therapy pioneered at Children's Hospital Boston. It uses fish oil to keep their livers healthy, and doctors and Ellie's parents say it helped save her life.

Babies like Ellie lack the ability to digest food or absorb nutrients. They need to be fed intravenously, but the IV nutrition can also damage their livers. But experiments recently showed that using a nutritional supplement made with fish oil instead of the standard one, made from soybean oil, did not cause liver damage.

So far, 112 children at Children's Hospital have been given the fish oil. The treatment is now available at 70 hospitals around the world. Although the data have not yet been published, more than 90 percent of the Children's Hospital patients are alive -- a remarkable rate for this serious illness, especially considering that the hospital often sees children who arrive from elsewhere in very bad shape."

Because of laboratory protocols that are routine for vaccine makers, mixing a live virus biological weapon with vaccine material by accident is virtually impossible.

Baxter flu vaccines contaminated with H5N1 (the human form of avian flu) were received by labs in the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovenia. Initially, Baxter refused to reveal how the vaccines were contaminated with H5N1, invoking “trade secrets.” After increased pressure, they then claimed that pure H5N1 batches were sent by accident.

But in the Czech Republic, reporters are investigating whether the contamination was part of a deliberate attempt to start a pandemic.

The fact that Baxter mixed the deadly H5N1 virus with a mix of H3N2 seasonal flu viruses may be the smoking gun. The H5N1 virus on its own has killed hundreds of people, but it is less airborne. However, when combined with seasonal flu viruses, which are more easily spread, the effect could be a potent, airborne, deadly biological weapon."

Fructose is much more readily metabolized to fat in the liver than glucose, and in the process can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. NAFLD in turn leads to hepatic insulin resistance and type II diabetes.
Researchers showed that mice fed a high-fructose diet could be protected from insulin resistance if a gene known as transcriptional coactivator PPARg coactivator-1b (PGC-1b) was ""knocked down"" in the animals' liver and fat tissue. PGC-1b controls the activity of several other genes, including one responsible for building fat in the liver. This suggests an important role for PGC-1b in the pathogenesis of fructose-induced insulin resistance."

Now a new debate looms over whether the U.S. should allow genetically altered corn to be grown for use as biofuel.

The Union of Concerned Scientists says no, arguing that genetically modified corn will inevitably mix with and contaminate corn grown for food products. Syngenta, a multi-national company that has readied a new genetically modified corn intended for ethanol production, has already applied for permission to sell its corn seed in the U.S., telling officials that it would control where the crops are grown so the GMO corn would not mix with the food supply.

Their newly developed “Corn Amylase” contains a protein that breaks down corn starch under high temperatures and could reduce the cost of ethanol production. The new protein has not been present in the food system, and would not have to be approved for human consumption.

If Syngenta’s voluntary methods of keeping the corn out of the food supply fail, people could be unwittingly exposed to the new protein, which is derived from organisms living near hot sea vents.

For these reasons, the Union of Concerned Scientists has urged the USDA to ban outdoor production of the new corn, as well as “any other food crop genetically engineered to produce pharmaceutical or industrial substances.”"

A widespread and silent killer that's worse for your health than alcohol, nicotine and many drugs is likely lurking in your kitchen cabinets right now.
""It"" is monosodium glutamate (MSG)1, a flavor enhancer that's known widely as an addition to Chinese food, but that's actually added to thousands of the foods you and your family regularly eat, especially if you are like most Americans and eat the majority of your food as processed foods or in restaurants.
MSG is one of the worst food additives on the market and is used in canned soups, crackers, meats, salad dressings, frozen dinners and much more. It's found in your local supermarket and restaurants, in your child's school cafeteria and, amazingly, even in baby food and infant formula.
MSG is more than just a seasoning like salt and pepper, it actually enhances the flavor of foods, making processed meats and frozen dinners taste fresher and smell better, salad dressings more tasty, and canned foods less tinny.
While MSG's benefits to the food industry are quite clear, this food additive could be slowly and silently doing major damage to your health.
What Exactly is MSG?
You may remember when the MSG powder called ""Accent"" first hit the U.S. market. Well, it was many decades prior to this, in 1908, that monosodium glutamate was invented. The inventor was Kikunae Ikeda, a Japanese man who identified the natural flavor enhancing substance of seaweed.
Taking a hint from this substance, they were able to create the man-made additive MSG, and he and a partner went on to form Ajinomoto, which is now the world's largest producer of MSG (and interestingly also a drug manufacturer). 2
Chemically speaking, MSG is approximately 78 percent free glutamic acid, 21 percent sodium, and up to 1 percent contaminants.3
It's a misconception that MSG is a flavor or ""meat tenderizer."" In reality, MSG has very little taste at all, yet when you eat MSG, you think the food you're eating has more protein and tastes better. It does this by tricking your tongue, using a little-known fifth basic taste: umami.
Umami is the taste of glutamate, which is a savory flavor found in many Japanese foods, bacon and also in the toxic food additive MSG. It is because of umami that foods with MSG taste heartier, more robust and generally better to a lot of people than foods without it.
The ingredient didn't become widespread in the United States until after World War II, when the U.S. military realized Japanese rations were much tastier than the U.S. versions because of MSG.
In 1959, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeled MSG as ""Generally Recognized as Safe"" (GRAS), and it has remained that way ever since. Yet, it was a telling sign when just 10 years later a condition known as ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"" entered the medical literature, describing the numerous side effects, from numbness to heart palpitations, that people experienced after eating MSG.
Today that syndrome is more appropriately called ""MSG Symptom Complex,"" which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identifies as ""short-term reactions"" to MSG. More on those ""reactions"" to come.
Why MSG is so Dangerous
One of the best overviews of the very real dangers of MSG comes from Dr. Russell Blaylock, a board-certified neurosurgeon and author of ""Excitotoxins: The Taste that Kills."" In it he explains that MSG is an excitotoxin, which means it overexcites your cells to the point of damage or death, causing brain damage to varying degrees -- and potentially even triggering or worsening learning disabilities, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease and more.
Part of the problem also is that free glutamic acid is the same neurotransmitter that your brain, nervous system, eyes, pancreas and other organs use to initiate certain processes in your body.4 Even the FDA states:
""Studies have shown that the body uses glutamate, an amino acid, as a nerve impulse transmitter in the brain and that there are glutamate-responsive tissues in other parts of the body, as well.
Abnormal function of glutamate receptors has been linked with certain neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's chorea. Injections of glutamate in laboratory animals have resulted in damage to nerve cells in the brain.""5
Although the FDA continues to claim that consuming MSG in food does not cause these ill effects, many other experts say otherwise.
According to Dr. Blaylock, numerous glutamate receptors have been found both within your heart's electrical conduction system and the heart muscle itself. This can be damaging to your heart, and may even explain the sudden deaths sometimes seen among young athletes.
He says:
""When an excess of food-borne excitotoxins, such as MSG, hydrolyzed protein soy protein isolate and concentrate, natural flavoring, sodium caseinate and aspartate from aspartame, are consumed, these glutamate receptors are over-stimulated, producing cardiac arrhythmias.
When magnesium stores are low, as we see in athletes, the glutamate receptors are so sensitive that even low levels of these excitotoxins can result in cardiac arrhythmias and death."" 6
Many other adverse effects have also been linked to regular consumption of MSG, including:
Obesity
Eye damage
Headaches
Fatigue and disorientation
Depression
Further, even the FDA admits that ""short-term reactions"" known as MSG Symptom Complex can occur in certain groups of people, namely those who have eaten ""large doses"" of MSG or those who have asthma.7
According to the FDA, MSG Symptom Complex can involve symptoms such as:
Numbness
Burning sensation
Tingling
Facial pressure or tightness
Chest pain or difficulty breathing
Headache
Nausea
Rapid heartbeat
Drowsiness
Weakness
No one knows for sure just how many people may be ""sensitive"" to MSG, but studies from the 1970s suggested that 25 percent to 30 percent of the U.S. population was intolerant of MSG -- at levels then found in food. Since the use of MSG has expanded dramatically since that time, it's been estimated that up to 40 percent of the population may be impacted.8
How to Determine if MSG is in Your Food
Food manufacturers are not stupid, and they've caught on to the fact that people like you want to avoid eating this nasty food additive. As a result, do you think they responded by removing MSG from their products? Well, a few may have, but most of them just tried to ""clean"" their labels. In other words, they tried to hide the fact that MSG is an ingredient.How do they do this? By using names that you would never associate with MSG.
You see, it's required by the FDA that food manufacturers list the ingredient ""monosodium glutamate"" on food labels, but they do not have to label ingredients that contain free glutamic acid, even though it's the main component of MSG.There are over 40 labeled ingredients that contain glutamic acid,9 but you'd never know it just from their names alone. Further, in some foods glutamic acid is formed during processing and, again, food labels give you no way of knowing for sure.
Tips for Keeping MSG Out of Your Diet
In general, if a food is processed you can assume it contains MSG (or one of its pseudo-ingredients). So if you stick to a whole, fresh foods diet, you can pretty much guarantee that you'll avoid this toxin.The other place where you'll need to watch out for MSG is in restaurants. You can ask your server which menu items are MSG-free, and request that no MSG be added to your meal, but of course the only place where you can be entirely sure of what's added to your food is in your own kitchen. To be on the safe side, you should also know what ingredients to watch out for on packaged foods. Here is a list of ingredients that ALWAYS contain MSG:
Autolyzed Yeast
Calcium Caseinate
Gelatin
Glutamate
Glutamic Acid
Hydrolyzed Protein
Monopotassium Glutamate
Monosodium Glutamate 
Sodium Caseinate
Textured Protein
Yeast Extract
Yeast Food
Yeast Nutrient


These ingredients OFTEN contain MSG or create MSG during processing:10
Flavors and Flavorings
Seasonings
Natural Flavors and Flavorings
Natural Pork Flavoring
Natural Beef Flavoring
Natural Chicken Flavoring
Soy Sauce
Soy Protein Isolate
Soy Protein
Bouillon
Stock
Broth
Malt Extract
Malt Flavoring
Barley Malt
Anything Enzyme Modified
Carrageenan
Maltodextrin
Pectin
Enzymes
Protease
Corn Starch
Citric Acid
Powdered Milk
Anything Protein Fortified
Anything Ultra-Pasteurized




So if you do eat processed foods, please remember to be on the lookout for these many hidden names for MSG.
Choosing to be MSG-Free
Making a decision to avoid MSG in your diet as much as possible is a wise choice for nearly everyone. Admittedly, it does take a bit more planning and time in the kitchen to prepare food at home, using fresh, locally grown ingredients. But knowing that your food is pure and free of toxic additives like MSG will make it well worth it.Plus, choosing whole foods will ultimately give you better flavor and more health value than any MSG-laden processed food you could buy at your supermarket."

The study looked at 20 healthy participants with an average age of 33. The results showed for the first time that laughter is linked to healthy function of blood vessels. It appears to cause the endothelium, which is the tissue that forms the inner lining of blood vessels, to dilate or expand in order to increase blood flow.

The study also showed that the opposite effect occurred when the subjects watched suspenseful films, suggesting a link between mental stress and the narrowing of blood vessels.

A separate study also found that viewing a humorous film may be helpful for the study and treatment of local IgE production and allergy in the reproductive tract."

Does that sound silly? It shouldn't. In fact, improving and maintaining the condition of your bowels is serious business.
Chances are you have digestive issues. And you're not alone. According to recent studies conducted by the Dannon Company in 2007, nearly 90 percent of Americans deal with occasional problems with digestion.1 Seventy percent of women say digestive concerns negatively impact their lives every single day.
Digestive concerns aren't a fun topic of conversation. In fact, many people have trouble talking to their own doctor about their concerns. Others suffer in silent embarrassment, worry and discomfort over the rumbling and gurgling -- the cramps, bloating and gas. The constipation. Or diarrhea.  
The fact is that if your digestive tract isn't operating efficiently, you have more to worry about than just your colon. When you carry around too few friendly bacteria and an overabundance of the bad stuff, your body doesn't make use of all the nutrients you're feeding it.
Your healthy diet won't matter, nor will the nutritional supplements you take. If your digestive system isn't operating efficiently, you aren't getting the full benefit of your good nutritional habits. Not only is your health at risk, but you're throwing money away on high-quality food and nutritional supplements that your body can't make use of.
The good news?
Improving the health of your digestive system is often a simple, straightforward process of achieving the right balance of good and bad gut bacteria. It's a matter of moving the right bacteria, in the right amounts, into permanent residence in your digestive tract. 
There are various ways to get the job done, some of which will be discussed later on in this report.
Three very positive changes occur when your good-to-bad intestinal bacteria ratio is brought into balance:
Your digestive symptoms diminish or disappear, leaving you comfortable and free to enjoy every day to the fullest.
Your body begins to use all the good food and nutritional supplements you feed it.
Your immune system de-stresses and is better equipped to fight off disease, contributing to a longer and healthier life.
A few interesting facts about intestinal bacteria:2
Your body is home to about one hundred trillion bacteria.
 There are 500 different species of bacteria comprising that population.
The ratio of good to bad bacteria is a critical measure in determining your overall health. The ideal balance is 85 percent good and 15 percent bad.
One of the jobs of good bacteria is to control the growth of bad bacteria by competing for nutrition and attachment sites in your colon.
Chances are you have a good idea... a gut feeling... whether your digestive system is working properly. What you probably don't know, though, is how things got out of whack to begin with.
If your colon has been suddenly overtaken by bad bacteria, it likely started in one of two3 ways.
Have you taken a course of antibiotics recently?
Antibiotics kill off both bad and good bacteria. If you don't have enough good bacteria in your colon to control the growth of the bad guys, the balance will tip in favor of unfriendly bacteria.
You've contracted disease-carrying bad guys such as the Clostridium difficile bacterium, or yeasts... or fungi. Perhaps even parasites.
But what if your digestive issues are as old as your memory or have gradually worsened over the years?
Some scientists are studying the possibility that we've taken the use of anti-bacterial products too far.4 They suspect that modern hygiene regimens result in too little exposure to helpful bacteria -- bacteria that protect us from allergies and other faulty immune responses.
Bacterial imbalance in your gut can be worsened by processed foods and foods that have been pasteurized or sterilized. 
Other factors affecting your good-to-bad bacteria ratio include where you live, your age, your stress level, and any health issues you may have.
The friendly bacteria that reside in your gut have a number of very important jobs to do.5
Digesting and absorbing certain carbohydrates.
Without good gut bacteria, your body cannot absorb certain undigested starches, fiber, and sugars. The friendly bacteria in your digestive tract convert these carbohydrates into primary sources of important energy and nutrients.
Keeping bad bacteria under control.
Simply stated, friendly bacteria compete with the bad guys for room and board in your digestive tract. Since beneficial bacteria are more at home there, they win most of the battles for nutrition and attachment sites within your colon.
The good bacteria tell your body how much nutrition they need and your body responds by supplying just that much and no more -- so that any excess bad bacteria are starved out. The helpful bacteria also produce a substance that kills harmful microbes.
Preventing allergies.
Friendly bacteria train your immune system to distinguish between pathogens and non-harmful antigens, and to respond appropriately. This important function prevents your immune system from overreacting to non-harmful antigens, which is the genesis of allergies.
Providing vital support to your immune system.
Beneficial bacteria have a lifelong, powerful affect on your gut's immune system and your systemic immune system as well. The bacteria play a crucial role the development and operation of the mucosal immune system in your digestive tract. They also aid in the production of antibodies to pathogens.
About 80 percent of the cells of your immune system are located in your digestive tract. With that in mind, it's easy to see why the health of your colon dictates your overall health.
When gut bacteria is out of balance not only is your digestion and feeling of well-being compromised, so is your immune system -- and therefore your ability to defend against serious illness and disease.
The list of conditions and diseases thought to be directly or indirectly related to a shortage of friendly gut bacteria is long and growing longer. It includes the following:
Gut-related issues:
Infectious diarrhea
Intestinal infection caused by the Clostridium difficile bacterium
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease)
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection which causes ulcers and chronic stomach inflammation
Leaky gut (a compromised intestinal wall that allows undigested foods and toxins to pass into the bloodstream, triggering an inappropriate immune system response)
Lactose intolerance
Surgery-related:
Pouchitis (a condition that sometimes results from removal of the colon)
Post surgical infections
Infections-related:
Stomach and respiratory infections in children in daycare settings
Urinary and female genital tract infections
Skin-related:
Skin infections
Atopic dermatitis (eczema)
Acne
Autism
Other:
Premenstrual syndrome
Bladder cancer
Diabetes
Tooth decay and gum disease
According to Dr. Martin Blaser, a pioneer in gut microbe research, chronic inflammatory conditions -- diseases like lupus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis -- are among the most challenging medical issues of our day.
Blaser, a NYU Medical Center microbiologist, believes that these diseases could be genetic or autoimmune in nature. OR... they could be a response to the gradual changes in gut flora that are the result of our modern lifestyles -- the drugs we take, the food we eat, and our growing obsession with all things anti-bacterial.

Helicobacter pylori, a strain of bacteria once present in all human guts, has mostly disappeared in the West.
The good news: H. pylori plays a major role in inflammations associated with peptic ulcers and certain stomach cancers, so it appears at first glance that eradication of this microbe is movement in the right direction. However...
The bad news: H. pylori has a benefit -- it actually reduces acid reflux. Acid reflux disease is serious in and of itself, but did you know that it's also implicated in both asthma and cancer of the esophagus?
Dr. Blaser, an expert in H. pylori, links the decline of the strain to the dramatic rise in acid reflux disease and associated conditions. Blaser also points to a connection between H. pylori depletion and obesity -- the bacteria help regulate production of hormones that act on appetite and metabolism.
The theory behind the dramatic rise in allergies and autoimmune diseases holds that we are actually suffering from a lack of bacterial exposure in our modern-day environments.
Scientists believe that early contact with microbes teaches our bodies to respond appropriately to pathogens later in life. It is a lack of exposure, according to experts, that is contributing to a rise in ineffective immune systems.
How attached you are to speed and convenience when it comes to making food choices?
Modern day convenience foods -- foods that are heavily processed and often loaded with sugar -- are essentially the equivalent of pesticides in farming.
Think about it. Pesticides are designed to quickly and conveniently kill plant bugs. What they also unavoidably kill, however, are the microorganisms in the soil, and ultimately, the soil itself.
In much the same way, processed and prepackaged foods are designed to quickly and conveniently kill your hunger or thirst, or both. 
But convenience foods are often so preservative-dense and nutrient-deficient that they do more harm than good inside your body. Among other things, they promote the growth of pathogens -- bad bugs -- thereby hampering the growth of beneficial bacteria in your gut. And you know where that leads -- right?
What, exactly, are processed foods?
Simply put, they are foods altered from their natural state.6 They might be canned, frozen, or dehydrated. They frequently contain trans fats, and high levels of sodium and sugar. A few processed foods can be healthier than others -- 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, for example. Or frozen vegetables.
Processed foods to be avoided include:
boxed meals (macaroni and cheese, hamburger and tuna 'helpers,' etc.)
chips and other high-calorie snack foods
foods made with refined white flour (white breads, pastas, rice)
frozen dinners
high-fat canned foods (spaghetti, for example)
packaged cakes and cookies
processed meats (sausage, hot dogs, bologna and other packaged lunch meats)
sodium-laden canned foods
sugared cereals
If you're planning to wean yourself from convenience foods, start by eliminating processed meats. They're the worst of the worst and are thought to increase your risk of certain types of cancers.
Even though the average modern American ingests over a half-cup of sugar every day -- 175 pounds per year -- it may surprise you to know that sugar is not a food.7 And your body doesn't like much of it since it has trouble digesting the stuff and making use of it.
Sugar promotes the growth of disease-causing yeasts and fungi. Symptoms of a yeast (candida) overgrowth include fatigue, lethargy, depression, irritability, headaches, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, recurrent vaginal and urinary tract infections, athlete's foot, jock itch, persistent heartburn, indigestion, constipation, swollen joints, nasal congestion and sore throat.8
Like processed foods, sugar encourages your bad gut bacteria to grow, flourish, and overwhelm your digestive tract.
And that's just for starters.
Sugar in all its forms is the number one source of calories in the American diet. It is also the number one reason 66 percent of Americans are overweight, and half of that group is obese.
The list of sugar consumption-related health problems -- over and above those associated with weight gain and obesity -- is long and impressive. Conditions and diseases that affect every square inch of you, inside and out, can be directly or indirectly the result of excessive sugar intake.
From problems with your eyesight to the very structure of your DNA -- from tooth decay to fluid retention to Alzheimer's to cancer -- sugar can play a role.
What you should avoid:
All artificial sweeteners, such as: NutraSweet, Equal, Splenda, sucralose and others
The obvious sweet and dessert-type stuff -- candy, gum, cookies, cakes, pies, pastries, ice cream, etc.
Cane syrup
Corn syrup and corn sugar
Invert sugar
All the -- oses, including dextrose, fructose, glucose, lactose, and maltose
In case you don't have reason enough yet to re-evaluate your sugar intake, here's another twist in the sugar-obesity connection. Researchers have discovered a difference in gut bacteria between the overweight and those of normal weight.9
In the obese, a bacterial strain known as firmicutes is found in much greater abundance than in leaner individuals. In those of normal weight, the bacteroidetes strain is in greater supply.
The firmicutes bacteria appear to be much better than the bacteroidetes strain at turning calories from complex sugars into fat. But as those who are overweight begin to slim down, the bacterial balance shifts from predominantly firmicutes to predominantly bacteroidetes.
Despite the fact that modern day lifestyles and habits have contributed to our digestive issues and related health concerns, the answer is not to turn back the clock.
There are steps you can take -- foods and supplements you can consume -- that will help to re-balance the bacteria in your digestive system and maintain it at an optimum level of health.
When your good-to-bad bacteria ratio is ideal (85 percent good to 15 percent bad), your digestive symptoms will subside. You can relax knowing that you are giving your immune system the support it needs to respond effectively to serious threats to your well-being.
In contrast to the pesticide effect of processed foods and sugar on the state of your health, fermented foods act as natural fertilizers, if you will -- providing nutrients and promoting growth of healthy bacteria in your digestive tract. 
For ages, humans have used fermented foods to improve intestinal health. In fact, people of Bulgarian and Asian descent are known for their longevity -- and their consumption of fermented foods.
Traditionally fermented foods contain living micro-organisms that replenish the friendly bacteria in your digestive tract.
A few of the foods in this group include:
Fermented milk
Natto
Miso
Kimchee
Tempeh
Kefir
Yogurt
Olives
Sauerkraut
Pickles
It is important to note that traditionally fermented foods are not the equivalent of the same foods, commercially processed.10 The only way to insure you're consuming the real thing is to prepare your own fermented foods at home.
The word probiotics means 'for life.' The dietary supplement was invented by Elie Metchnikoff, a Russian physiologist and Nobel prize winner. Metchnikoff was the first to suggest that consuming acid-producing live organisms maintained the vitality of your large intestine, leading to a longer and healthier life.12
Like those found in traditionally fermented foods, the live micro-organisms in probiotic supplements help to replenish and maintain the friendly bacteria in your intestinal tract. Good bacteria drive down the pH of your gut, which creates an inhospitable environment for bad bacteria. The result is that the good guys flourish and the bad guys are kept in check.
How often should you take a probiotic supplement? Taken daily, probiotics will help ease any current digestive upsets you're experiencing and will also act to maintain the bacterial balance in your gut longer term. 
What you should look for in a probiotic supplement:
No need for refrigeration
Long shelf life
Can survive stomach acid so that it reaches your small intestine
Stays resident in your digestive tract long enough to be effective
There is mounting evidence that probiotic supplements can be beneficial for everyone -- from infants to the elderly -- for a wide range of symptoms, conditions and diseases.
Infants and children
Probiotics have gained recognition as an effective treatment for diarrhea in children. They have also been used in newborns and infants to repair and support the reliability of their developing digestive systems.
What you might not know is that a number of studies are planned or underway to test the benefit of probiotics in treating a wide variety of other conditions and childhood health issues:
Probiotics are being considered in the treatment of children with HIV/AIDS.13
A study is currently underway to see if probiotic supplements can prevent asthma in children.14
Still another study was conducted to gauge the impact of probiotic supplementation on the oral health of children.15
A European study reported good results in achieving relief of colic in infants.16
There is evidence that probiotics can prevent eczema in infants.17
The beneficial effects of probiotics on GI symptoms related to autism have also been studied.18
Women We've already discussed the benefits probiotics can provide to the vast majority of women who suffer from digestive distress. However, there are a number of other health issues specific to women that may also be positively impacted by probiotic supplementation. Among them:
 Urogenital infections19
Immune system support during pregnancy and breastfeeding20
Aging Boomers and the elderly
Around age 60, there is a significant drop in the number of bacteria in our guts.21
People over 60 have 1,000 times less friendly bacteria than younger adults. The drop in helpful bacteria increases susceptibility to bowel disorders and infections. Infections may necessitate treatment by antibiotics, which further decimate the good bug count... and you see where this can head. 
Clearly, a daily probiotic supplement is an excellent way for older adults to replenish and maintain friendly intestinal bacteria.
Also as you age, your cellular immunity declines.22 (These are the white cells that are absolutely critical to your ability to fight infection and life-threatening diseases such as cancer.) 
A nine-week New Zealand study of seniors 63 to 84 indicated that consumption of the probiotic strain known as Bifidobacterium lactis results in increases in both the number and disease-fighting capacity of white cells. And in fact, the greatest improvement was seen in seniors with the worst immune system responses prior to the study.
Dr. Joseph E. Pizzorno, Jr., physician and former member of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy, uses probiotics to treat irritable bowel syndrome, acne, eczema -- even PMS.
Says Pizzorno, ""It's unusual for me to see a patient with a chronic disease that doesn't respond to probiotics.""
Two things are clear:
Sufficient amounts of friendly bacteria are fundamental to your good health. It's impossible to be optimally healthy if your gut's bacterial balance is out of whack. 
Your lifestyle -- your diet, medications, the antibacterial cleansers you use, and other factors outside your control -- are working together to compromise the number of lifesaving friendly bacteria in your digestive system.
Maintaining a good balance of gut bacteria through diet and regular probiotic supplementation is one of the most important things you can do to increase your chances of remaining healthy and vital for a lifetime.

Do you want more energy? Maybe drop a couple of sizes?  Do you want to improve your health? Look years younger? Give your immune system a boost? If so, then it's time to consider juicing. 
I have previously written an extensive guide to juicing  but Cherie Calbom, the original Juice Lady, released the third edition of her best-selling book The Juice Lady's Guide To Juicing for Health: Unleashing the Healing Power of Whole Fruits and Vegetables in October 2008.  
I recently spoke with her about what she learned in preparation for her new book. The most remarkable news from the juicing world is in the area of clinical research, offering mounting scientific evidence for juicing's health benefits. 
One notable study explored the effects of beetroot juice on blood pressure. Those who consumed 20 ounces of beetroot juice started to show reductions in blood pressure after just one hour. After about 2.5 hours, all participants who had the juice began to show significant reductions in both their systolic and diastolic readings. 
Another significant study called the Kame Project concluded that fruits and vegetables might play an important role in delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease. People who drank juices (fruit and vegetable) more than three times per week, compared to less than once a week, were 76 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.  
Many more studies have yielded positive findings, which are nicely outlined in Cherie's book. The research is just confirming what you already know—that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can greatly improve your fitness and vitality.  
Why Should You Juice? 
You might think that you can get the same benefits by eating your veggies whole, why go through the trouble of juicing them? 
According to Cherie, juice is therapeutic. It is a nutrient-dense ""living"" broth that is absorbed almost instantly, requiring little effort by your body. It is almost like receiving an intravenous infusion of vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that goes right into your system without having to be broken down. Since it can be utilized by your body immediately, those who juice report feeling the ""kick"" of energy almost instantly.  
This is not to suggest replacing all your veggies and fruits with juice. Juicing is a supplement to your diet, and you need the insoluble fiber from whole foods as well. But juicing is a fantastic way to pack in more vegetables than you would ordinarily eat.  
Speaking of fiber, you might be surprised to know that juice actually contains some fiber—of the soluble variety. Soluble fiber is present in juice in the form of pectin, gums, and mucilage. This soluble fiber helps lower your cholesterol, stabilize blood sugar, and encourages good bowel bacteria. 
Juicing concentrates the most nutrient-dense parts of the plants in the juice. In the past, some have claimed that a significant amount of nutrients remained in the fiber after juicing, but that theory has been disproved. The Department of Agriculture analyzed twelve fruits and found that 90 percent of the antioxidant activity was in the juice, rather than the fiber. 
Making your own juice allows you to use a wider variety of vegetables, leaves, and stems that you might not otherwise eat, expanding your range of nutrients.   
Raw juice also contains something very special—biophotonic light energy—which revitalizes your body. Fresh, raw juice is a ""live food"" with a full complement of vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and enzymes. Commercially processed, canned, bottled, frozen or otherwise packaged juices have been pasteurized, meaning the juice has been exposed to high temperatures, and many of the vitamins and enzymes have been killed or removed.  
The light of ""living juice"" has actually been seen with Kirlian photography. Kirlian photos of cooked vegetables and pasteurized juice reveal very little ""light"" emanating from them.  
One very important benefit of juicing has to do with alkalizing your body. Most people's bodies are too acidic. Nearly all who suffer from chronic illness have this acidity problem. Vegetables are alkaline, so when you juice, it will raise the pH of your body to a more beneficial level.  
Remember, as good as juicing is, you still need to pay attention to your nutritional type, in terms of how much juice to consume daily, and what kind. You might want to review my guidelines about juicing for each nutritional type before employing juicing into your food plan. For tips on choosing a juicer, my juicer page might helpful. 
The Top Three Benefits of Juicing 
Cherie shared her thoughts about what she considers to be the top three benefits of juicing:
1.    Weight management
2.    Increased energy
3.    Boosted immune system 
Over the years, thousands of readers have emailed the Juice Lady with their personal stories and experiences of juicing. One of the things she has been most struck by is the ""side effect"" reported in literally hundreds of emails—significant weight loss.  
This weight loss is experienced not only by people who have that as a goal, but also by those who do not. Many—in fact, the majority—of people start juicing as a way to improve their health and energy. But even these folks have noticed the pounds ""falling off,"" as she described it. People from all over the world have written her about this phenomenon. 
She suggests this may be a result of the fact that acids are stored in fat cells, and when the pH becomes better balanced with alkaline foods such as vegetable juices, your body will let go of fat cells and the acids they contain. I would also add that people who are juicing are likely eating less processed food and junk food, feeling better and having more energy, and as a result are more active, which would contribute to shedding excess pounds. When your body has an abundance of the nutrients it needs, and the pH is optimally balanced, you do feel energized.  
Juicing can supercharge your immune system with its concentration of beneficial phytochemicals. Phytochemicals are the substances plants contain that protect them from disease, injury and pollution. For example, the average tomato contains up to 10,000 different types of phytochemicals, the most famous being lycopene, which has been shown to lower the risk of stomach and prostate cancer. 
Research has shown that people whose diets are highest in phytonutrients (ie, plants) have the lowest incidence of cancer and other diseases, and raw juices give you these vital substances in concentrated form. Here are just a few of the immune-boosting plant heroes and what they do for you: 
Allyl sulfides, found in garlic and onions, have been found to lower your risk for stomach cancer
Curcumins, present in ginger and turmeric, stimulate the activity of glutathione S-transferases, which are thought to be cancer inhibitors
Ellagic acid, found in grapes and strawberries, neutralizes carcinogenic agents, preventing them from altering cellular DNA (a first step in the development of cancer)
Gingerol, from ginger, has been shown to reduce inflammation, lower cholesterol, and heal ulcers
Monoterpenes, found in cherries, have been found to lower the risk of breast, skin, liver, lung, stomach, and pancreatic cancer
Choose Organic Produce 
The popularity of organic produce has increased dramatically over the years, and for good reason. Not only do you avoid the health-damaging pesticides and herbicides--which get concentrated in your juice just as the good nutrients do--but organic produce has now been shown by a number of studies to be more nutritious than inorganic produce. 
A $25-million four-year study of organic food, funded by the European Union, found that organic fruits and vegetables contain up to 40 percent more antioxidants. Organic produce had higher levels of beneficial minerals like iron and zinc. In fact, the milk from organically raised cows contains 60 percent more antioxidants and fatty acids than ordinary milk.  
Another study, this one a doctoral dissertation by Virginia Worthington at John Hopkins University in 2001, revealed: 
27 percent more vitamin C in organic produce than in the conventionally grown vegetables
21 percent more iron
29 percent more magnesium
13 percent more phosphorous, and
15 percent fewer nitrates
There should be no remaining doubt that buying organic produce is well worth the effort and additional cost. If you can't buy all organic, be sure to at least avoid the ""Dirty Dozen.""  
Juicing = Happiness 
Cherie reports that her greatest ""surprise"" over the years has been the number of emails she receives from people reporting that juicing has led them to greater happiness. Letter after letter comes in with comments about how much happier people are since incorporating a juicing lifestyle. 
And it makes perfect sense. If you are healthy, you feel good. If you feel good, life is more enjoyable—and an enjoyable life is a happy life."

Interestingly, the US media is now pronouncing that the worst may be over for the US economic crisis. While it would be a great delight to see that happen, every possible piece of evidence I have been able to review does not support this optimism. There are still over 65 trillion dollars of derivatives that could blow up at a moment's notice and could easily dwarf what has happened in the US in the past 18 months.
A recent MetLife study found that 50 percent of Americans said they have only a one-month cushion -- roughly two paychecks -- or less before they would be unable to fully meet their financial obligations if they were to lose their jobs. More disturbing is that 28 percent said they could not make ends meet for longer than two weeks without their jobs.
And it's not just low-income earners who would find themselves financially challenged. Twenty-nine percent of those making $100,000 or more a year said they would have trouble paying the bills after more than a month of unemployment.
We are clearly living in interesting times, to say the least. The economic crisis is affecting each and every one of us in some way, and it is impossible to separate your financial state from your health.
When I posted my concerns about the economy last month, many were critical because there was not enough focus on what they could do, so in response to those concerns I have compiled this guide to provide you with the best positive steps I know of to protect you and your family in the coming months and years.
So I had a friend of mine, Jim Ehmke, who is a top-notch nutritionist and someone to whom I look for personal guidance in this area, write an article to help provide everyone with some recommendations. Although Jim has no formal economic or financial training, he has studied this area for decades, and when anyone invests that much time in one discipline they tend to become a world-class expert in that area.
While I was in Maui this year, one of the books I read was Outliers, the Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell. It is an excellent book and provides the scientific basis for the observation that when one invests over 10,000 hours in learning, studying and practicing a discipline; they invariably tend to become a master. Jim would certainly qualify with the amount of time he has invested studying this topic.
Preparing for the Perfect Economic Storm
By Jim Ehmke (email: ehmke5@aol.com)
Worst-case scenarios are something that few of us want to think about.
Personally, I consider myself an optimistic person who tries to live and act consciously in a positive way. I regularly seek to avoid negative and even horrifying thoughts and emotions.
And yet, sadly, negative and horrifying events occur worldwide on a regular basis regardless of my feelings. Are those of us who live in relative comfort oblivious to the possibility that worst-case scenarios might occur in our lives?
Let's consider briefly how we participate, consciously or unconsciously, to prepare ourselves for crisis. And, in fact, this behavior is considered normal and healthy.
Consider the following:
Health Insurance -- this is actually insurance against disease, catastrophic health events and even death. Today's news is filled with the fear and consequences of not having health insurance. The positive aspects of vibrant health have almost nothing to do with health insurance.
Life Insurance -- this should more accurately be called ""death insurance,"" because that's what it is. Death is one worst-case scenario that we all eventually deal with.
All the other ""insurances"" -- automobile, fraud, disability, homeowners, mortgage, etc. -- seem to offer us some level of protection from various disasters.
Parents routinely take enormous precautions for the safety of their children, far more today than when I was a kid. For example, consider infant safety seats and seat belts for children.
Gun ownership as ""insurance"" against predators.
Our legal system -- this is set up to provide protection against many worst-case scenarios.
And all the other things we do to protect against worst-case scenarios that are not mentioned above. I'm sure we could all think of more.
In light of this rather normal behavior, it strikes me that something is missing regarding preparation for a financial worst-case scenario. One example is the very economic scenario that is playing out right before our eyes.
For the most part we have been trained to put all our financial eggs in one basket -- the basket of paper assets; stocks, bonds, currency and highly leveraged high risk derivative instruments that have no sensible meaning to most of us.
Paper Money May Be Worthless
It seems prudent to have some stocks and bonds, and obviously currency is necessary, but in this day and age the high risk paper mentioned above has put the average investor at a disadvantage which he or she is simply not prepared to deal with.
We are now seeing the unwinding of this uncollateralized paper, and the ramifications are staggering in their severity. Estimates of how much bad derivative paper is out there, depending on the expert, range from 300 trillion to 500 trillion dollars. The subprime debt which exposed the far greater derivative nightmare pales in comparison.
This is truly a staggering amount, at least it is to me, and dwarfs worldwide GDP (gross domestic product) several times over.
Most of us have not taken the time to genuinely investigate how to balance our personal economic situation and protect ourselves against the fraud, greed and excesses that have caused paper assets to crash in such a dramatic fashion. And most experts agree that it isn't over yet -- there is a lot of de-leveraging yet to occur.
Gold Standard
Until 1971, the world of paper assets and currency was balanced with the gold standard. Gold provided a physical storehouse of wealth that was used to balance trade deficits and prevent unlimited printing of paper money.
Gold established and maintained economic discipline and balance. The use of gold in this fashion was agreed to by all the major countries in what is known as the Bretton Woods Accord.
But when President Nixon dissolved Bretton Woods, the modern world was thrown into uncharted waters; without the discipline of the gold standard, a new era of unlimited money creation was ushered in. Over decades, this eventually spawned an economy based overwhelmingly on debt, deficits, inflation, currency manipulation and unimaginable (at least to most of us) instruments called derivatives.
And now this house of cards is crashing and the economic worst-case scenario, for which few have prepared, is upon us.
Precious Metals are Real-Money Tangible Assets
The positive thing to do in such a situation is to protect yourself and your family by investing in the ultimate tangible asset, also known as real money; gold and silver. My experience in the precious metals business has taught me that the best way to do this is to take possession of the physical product.
Although there are gold 'paper instruments' including ETFs and even gold derivatives, why risk paper when it's easy and convenient to possess gold.
It's simple to do and you are in complete control of your assets. A client in his early 80's recently told me:
""Jim, I've made and lost two fortunes in my life and the most important thing I've learned is to be in control of my money. Don't trust other people to handle your money.""
There's no simpler way to do this than to possess precious metals and cash. At this time $100,000 in gold weighs just over 6 pounds and fits in less than one quarter of a shoebox. Gold is the ultimate portable wealth; it's a small package and is universally transacted. In a normal situation gold or silver can be converted into paper money in a day with a phone call.
In dire circumstances, both can be used for barter. Gold and silver are readily available in one ounce, half ounce, quarter ounce and tenth ounce increments. Larger gold bars are also available, but they're not practical for barter transactions and the price difference between larger bars and one-ounce coins is minimal.
One unique form of silver is pre 1965 US change; halves, quarters and dimes were all 90 percent silver. The precious metals industry call this ""junk silver,"" an oxymoron if ever there was one, but it's one of the most desirable forms of silver to own.
Not only because junk silver is a hot item to buy and sell, but because it provides outstanding flexibility in barter situations where a one ounce gold coin worth a thousand dollars or more isn't practical. Owning mixed denominations of silver coins makes good sense.
Did you know the Constitution of the U.S. forbids any currency other than gold and silver?
It's true.
The writers of the Constitution knew that this requirement would prevent banks from taking over the money supply and indebting the people. Of course, this is all to the benefit of banks but often to the misfortune of citizens. The founders knew this happened in Europe and they were intent to prevent it from happening here.
Ultimately, the greed, abuse and criminal behavior of banks has led to what is occurring today. And now we, the citizens, are coerced into bailing out the bankers. This is not right. As Dr. Nouriel Roubini, Professor of Economics and International Business at New York University, so aptly stated:
""This is again a case of privatizing the gains and socializing the losses, a bailout and socialism for the rich, the well-connected, and Wall Street. And it is a scandal that even congressional Democrats have fallen for, this Treasury scam, which does little to resolve the debt burden of millions of distressed home owners.""
How to Obtain Precious Metals
Buying and selling gold and silver is incredibly simple.
Over the phone, the customer and the dealer agree on a price. This is called a ""lock-in"" and the agreed-to price holds, no matter what happens to the price of gold between agreement and delivery.
Precious metals, like jewelry and diamonds and other valuable items, are mailed to the buyer via U.S. Post Registered & Insured for full value. The warehouse I work for has never had a package lost since opening in 1971. Nor has any warehouse I am aware of. Registered and Insured mail is handled separately and every handler must sign off on the package.
In the unlikely event that something should go wrong, the warehouse will replace the gold and go after the insurance. It is the buyer's responsibility to send payment by wire or check as soon as possible. As incredible as it may seem, the gold business is routinely conducted in this fashion -- where a person's word is their bond. I find this incredibly refreshing.
Selling gold or silver back to the warehouse is just as simple as buying it. Simply call and lock-in a buy-back price. Mail the product to the warehouse (registered & insured), and your funds will be wired or mailed.
The Bull Markets Have Three Basic Phases
All bull markets have three basic phases:
1. Phase One: Investor Accumulation
2. Phase Two: Public Involvement
3. Phase Three: Speculation
Phase One is quiet accumulation by savvy investors who recognize the emerging bull and quietly accumulate. This is exactly what has been transpiring in gold since 2000 when the price was $253 per ounce. Since then, gold as steadily climbed up to $1,000 per ounce with almost no public awareness.
After all, have you been reading about the remarkable gold bull market in the papers or have you heard about it on TV? No, not until just recently.
Phase Two of bull markets occurs when the public gets involved. This is exactly where the gold bull market finds itself at present. Obviously, the public is now taking interest, and judging by the number of calls I receive and the size of the orders, I know firsthand that public interest is heating up ... big time.
Newspapers, TV and other media outlets are all abuzz with info on gold, as well they should be. Big players like Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg and others now recommend gold as an investment. Morgan Stanley is projecting $1,650 per ounce gold by the end of 2009, and others forecast $2,000 per ounce.
Of course, no one knows for sure, but as the public enters the gold bull market en masse, the price is sure to soar. Moreover, the economic fundamentals, which have led to the current collapse in paper wealth as well as the gold bull market, have not changed at all.
In fact, the incredible amount of money creation for bailing out the big boys, based on yet more debt, will ultimately lead to increased inflation -- some say hyperinflation -- which is the perfect storm for gold. Gold is universally acknowledged as the ultimate hedge against the ravages of inflation.
For example, from 1971 to 1980, inflation soared to 21percent while gold increased from $35 to $850 per ounce -- a remarkable 24-fold increase!
Phase Three of bull markets is the speculation phase, when speculators and gamblers push prices to ridiculous levels and create bubbles. This is exactly what happened with two recent bull markets: the dot-com bubble and the real estate bubble.
How Much is Enough?
Of course, how much gold and silver to own is highly debatable and the answer will vary depending on who you listen to. I hearken back to a time when I was a kid in the sixties and listened to the Louis Rukeyser Show.
A time when the Dow was in triple digits and everything was quite conservative. There were no derivatives, debt was frowned upon and, believe it or not, the U.S. ran a huge trade surplus. Ah, those where the days.
His guests would routinely outline their portfolios and it seemed like everyone had a 10 percent position in gold. This was the conservative hedge against a crash or war or any unexpected event.
Gold fell out of favor in the 80's when dramatic mergers and debt instrument and speculation really began to dominate Wall Street.
This world of abstract wealth which spawned conspicuous consumption as a way of life continued through the 90's resulting in various bubbles, all of which popped, and slowly began to turn with the onset of the current gold bull market in 2000. But after 20 years of the ""paper bull"" a new generation of ""financial advisers"" emerged who had no experience with gold or hard times.
This younger generation of financial advisors frowned on gold considering it too risky and preferred paper. Now that's a kick. Hmm ... real money in the form of gold, which has always been the ultimate form of wealth and will always be the last man standing, is too risky? How could paper be more valuable or safer?
Granted, gold doesn't pay interest, nor do most stocks pay dividends, but in a gold bull market this becomes less important.
So, how much of one's portfolio should be put in precious metals?
Personally, my wife, Karen, and I have over 80 percent in precious metals and 20 percent in cash and a house. It's simple for us and we both sleep well.
The Sleep Test
I think the ""sleep test,"" is a good way to determine how much risk is healthy; Don't make any financial moves that disturb your sleep, and if you do change them. This said, I realize that 80 percent is likely to be too high for many, not that it would disrupt your sleep.
It's just 'outside the box' of habitual economic thinking. But, 50 percent seems quite reasonable considering that gold is just entering the second phase of an epic bull market and it's about the only way to protect yourself against the ravages of a deteriorating economy that will feature overt depreciation of paper money, i.e., inflation.
Ultimately, whatever amount you are comfortable with is the right amount to invest. Whatever that is will prove to be a smart move. Perhaps the smartest money move you'll ever make. It certainly has been for us.
Health is Your Greatest Wealth
I am fortunate to have a wonderful career in the alternative health field since 1975. Economically, I've observed and studied the markets and have been investing in gold since the mid 80's. This June will be my third anniversary selling precious metals. But, ultimately, when all is said and done, what matters most is health.
Many times in my practice I've observed how stress adversely affects clients. Unfortunately, severe money stress is one of the most common experiences in our culture.
Other Helpful Comments from Readers
A number of our readers also contributed some great comments that were posted in my last major article on the economy. Many times these nuggets are lost in the large number of posts so I thought I would highlight a few of them for you now.
The great icon of self-help success books, Napoleon Hill, author of the classic Think and Grow Rich, taught that the fear of poverty is the number one stress that impairs and stifles people on a day-to-day basis.
Hill claimed there were six basic fears, and only the fear of death was more intense than the fear of poverty. As Mercola reader Crouchingkitty from Boulder, Colorado commented in a recent article:
""Our family has already been through the worst scenario financially, husband was unemployed for three years and we lost our home last year.

It felt like death as we sold everything of monetary value, lost the rest, and our family of three moved into a 1000 square foot studio rental in the mountains. So it didn't feel so bad when my employer went out of business last month, and my husband's hours were cut (at a job that already pays just 1/3 of his old pay). The worst part of it all was the time of fear before the house was lost.

Now I LOVE my life! It has been reborn as a life of connection and meaning!""
The more you can modify your lifestyle and take charge of the things that you do have some control over, the less stress you will feel, and the less fear you will have. Sometimes just seeing the situation as an opportunity rather than a crisis is enough to take the sting out of your circumstance.
Crouchingkitty goes on to say:
""My new-found open positive attitude attracted a community of people that has enabled us to live this new beautiful life. It is a life I never could've imagined 18 months ago, or even 5 years ago! I see the worries of the country, but from my experience it is an opportunity for a huge paradigm shift.""
Some of your recent comments have emphasized the importance of being proactive. A reader from Syracuse, New York named Frasmus commented:
""My family and I have been anticipating a crisis like what is coming for quite a while and preparing ourselves the best we can. I offer the following suggestions:
If you have a high mortgage that is difficult now, the bank may foreclose eventually. Better to deal with it now. Sell your house and take the loss or just give it back to the bank. If you have elderly parents that own a home, consider moving in with them. You could care for them and offer your protection. Live in the country if possible.
Get back to the basics. Shed anything with a monthly payment. Expensive cable tv and car payments are the obvious ones. If you live in a cold climate, can you find a way to heat for free? It may be better to use fuel that is grown locally. Think ""Little House on the Prairie.""
I completely agree that the best defense is a good offense. Do what you can now, so that you will be in a better position if things do become worse globally.
Many of my readers are sharing ideas about simplifying their lives, returning to activities of the past such as barter and trade, instead of relying solely on paper money. Frasmus went on to say:
""Finally, be able to produce something people need that is easy to barter. We bought a grain mill so hopefully farmers will have wheat. We make the bread. We trade bread for firewood, etc. Community is critical. Think, ""How can I trade if the dollar is dead?"" Have something useful to use as currency.""
Some of you talk about moving out into the country where you have some land and can be more self-sufficient. Some of you are raising goats for milk, making your own cheese and yogurt, creating your own organic gardens, home schooling your children, making your own herbal ointments, and even trading childcare services for electric bills!
And all of these things are wonderfully positive responses to this economic crisis, turning an otherwise frightening situation into something new and productive.
The resourcefulness of the American people remains one of our greatest strengths.
A reader by the name of Mitchind from Arcadia, Australia commented recently on turning hemp into plastics, lightweight building material, biodiesel, paper, clothing, and other industrially useful fibers.
Another reader mentions using algae oil for fuel, stating it can be produced ""thousands of times faster than any other crop, including hemp.""
There is no shortage of ideas -- just look at the fantastic bunch of them from my website readers alone! For even more inspiring ideas, check out this recent msnbc.com article in its entirety, which includes such nuggets as:
Remain optimistic by accomplishing five things each day: one thing for your job search, one for your community, one for your family, one thing to improve your home, and one thing for your own spirit.
See the big picture by taking inventory of what's really important and what makes you truly happy. Then remain focused on what really matters
Unwind with cheap or free entertainment
Cook, and even grow your own food
Give to others in need
As long as we don't succumb to fear, I am confident we will see our way through the challenges of this economic ""paradigm shift,"" if I may borrow that term.
There is no reason you must buy into the doom and gloom that the media loves to promote, and instead seize on the chance for a new beginning. Virtually everyone has a fear of poverty, and it behooves us to make cautious and wise investments with our resources. Our health may literally depend on it.
Right now, as the world is immersed in a crisis of paper wealth that threatens to get much worse, it seems to me that participating in the only available bull market -- gold and silver -- makes good sense.
Improving your economic health will almost assuredly improve your physical and emotional health by reducing stress and helping you feel more in control of your life.
Sleep well; it's great for your health."

Fluoride, one of the most consumed drugs in the United States, is deliberately added to about two-thirds of U.S. public water supplies, theoretically to reduce tooth decay, even though there's no scientifically-valid evidence proving either safety or effectiveness.
In this video, Dr. Bill Osmunson, general and cosmetic dentist for 30 years, talks about how he came to change his mind about water fluoridation, which he promoted aggressively for the first 25 years of his practice. He thought he saw the benefits, but it wasn't until he actually reviewed the information for himself that he began to realize that fluoridation is a serious problem.
Why Does Toothpaste Carry a Warning But Fluoridated Water Does Not?
One of the first things he did was look at a tube of toothpaste, which clearly carries the warning: ""Do not swallow,"" and ""in case of accidental ingestion, contact the poison control center.""
The amount of fluoride they're talking about is a quarter milligram of fluoride, contained in a pea size amount of toothpaste.
But here is the kicker, This is the same amount of fluoride you find in 8 oz of water. Yet toothpaste carries a ""Do not swallow"" warning, whereas you're typically told to drink eight 8oz glasses of water each day, without any concern for the amount of fluoride you will ingest.
One of Dr. Osmunson's main concerns is water fluoridation for infants. The American Dental Association (ADA) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that infants NOT receive fluoridated water for drinking, nor for making their formula, as fluoridated water contains 250 times more fluoride than mother's milk.
""We shouldn't fluoridate water and harm our most vulnerable,"" he says.
Personally, I also strongly advise you do not give your children fluoridated water.
Unfortunately, the only way to ensure your water is pure enough to drink is by installing a good water filtration system in your house, such as a reverse osmosis filter that can filter out fluoride and other dangerous water contaminants like disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Bottled water also typically contains fluoride, even though it's not stated on the label.
Dental Fluorosis – A Clear Sign of Excessive Fluoride Intake
The next thing Dr. Osmunson looked at was dental fluorosis. These are the white and brown spots on your teeth. The only thing that causes dental fluorosis is fluoride – typically due to ingesting too much fluoride during your developing years, from birth to about 8 years of age. According to the CDC, about one third of children and adolescents 6 to 19 years have enamel fluorosis on their teeth.
When dental fluorosis occurs, it can be an indication that the rest of your body has been exposed to too much fluoride also, such as your bones and the rest of your organs, including your brain.
So, are there actual benefits of water fluoridation?
Depending on the source, water fluoridation has been said to reduce tooth decay by anywhere from 20 to 80 percent. But when you compare the statistics between different countries, you see that no matter whether they fluoridate their water or not, tooth decay has steadily been reduced by the same amount.
Likewise, when you compare states in the U.S., you find that increased amounts of fluoride in the drinking water make no difference. We have the same amount of good healthy teeth, regardless of water fluoridation.
So, if there's no benefit, WHY are we fluoridating?
Why Do We Fluoridate Drinking Water if It's Not Healthy?
The evidence points to it being little more than a well-orchestrated PR stunt to aid an industry in trouble – a fascinating story in and of itself, as described so well in Christopher Bryson's book The Fluoride Deception and in one of the best web sites on this topic, Fluoride Action Network (FAN).
Other pro-fluoride advocates go so far as to try to make you believe that fluoride is a nutrient that naturally helps build strong teeth and bones. One such example is the Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, which lists ""fluoride"" as one of only 28 vitamins and minerals permissible for sale for human consumption within the European Union. 
But let's make this point clear: fluoride is NOT an essential nutrient. The fluoride added to your drinking water is in fact a chemical waste product! It is NOT something you should use as a supplement to your diet.
There are plenty of studies showing the dangers of fluoride to your health, such as:
Increases lead absorption
Disrupts synthesis of collagen
Hyperactivity and/or lethargy
Muscle disorders
Brain damage, and lowered IQ
Arthritis
Dementia
Bone fractures
Lowers thyroid function
Bone cancer (osteosarcoma)
Inactivates 62 enzymes
Inhibits formation of antibodies
Genetic damage and cell death
Increases tumor and cancer rate
Disrupts immune system
Damages sperm and increases infertility
  The Key to Healthy Teeth is in Your Diet!
If you're wondering how to keep your teeth healthy, remember that fluoride was never the answer in the first place. Instead, look to your diet for naturally healthy teeth. In fact, most people whose diet includes very little sugar and few processed foods have very low rates of tooth decay.  
Limiting, or eliminating sugar, and avoiding processed foods -- along with regular cleanings with your natural dentist -- will ensure that your teeth stay healthy naturally.
What You Can Do to Help Eliminate Water Fluoridation
Dr. Osmunson suggests you talk to your dentist and health care provider about water fluoridation. For example, ask them if they've seen the National Academy of Sciences report on fluoridation. You can help educate them by giving them information they may not have on water fluoridation and excess fluoridation exposure.
He also suggests that professional health care providers and dentists take the time to look at both sides of the issue. If you are a professional in the field, you may also want to add your name to the online Professional Statement at www.FluorideAlert.org. As of April 2009, 2,221 medical and environmental health professionals have signed this statement, calling for an end to water fluoridation."

Most companies use species of fish that are lower on the food chain, like cod and sardines, that accumulate less mercury. Many companies also distill their oils to help remove contaminants.
A report by ConsumerLab.com, which conducts independent tests of supplements, examined 41 common fish oil products and found none contaminated with mercury or PCBs.

The change comes after three decades during which HFCS had been gaining on sugar in the American diet. Consumption of the two finally drew even in 2003, according to the Department of Agriculture.

Ever since Nixon, government policy has been to sell large quantities of calories as cheaply as possible -- especially calories coming from corn. Now, a quarter of the 45,000 items in the average supermarket contain processed corn, often in the form of high-fructose corn syrup.
The result?

Rates of chronic diseases like cancer and Type 2 diabetes are much higher today than they were in 1900. Type 2 diabetes is a $100 billion a year consequence of, among other things, obesity related to a corn-based diet. Four of the top 10 causes of American deaths -- coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke and cancer – have well-established links to diet as well.

Making matters worse, by now you may have seen “crystalline fructose” as an ingredient in beverages.

If you’ve been wondering what it was, it turns out that crystalline fructose “is produced by allowing the fructose to crystallize from a fructose-enriched corn syrup.” This information is from the sugar producers themselves. So, it is made from corn syrup, and not only corn syrup, but “fructose enriched” corn syrup. Sounds like another name for high fructose corn syrup.
Fructose and glucose are metabolized differently in the body. Glucose is metabolized in every cell in the body, but all fructose must be metabolized in the liver. When a diet includes a large amount of fructose, then it creates a fatty liver, and even cirrhosis. Crystalline Fructose contains a 99.5 percent minimum of fructose assay, which is an even higher percentage of fructose than regular HFCS!
Another ingredient of crystalline fructose is arsenic. Additional chemical compounds that make up crystalline fructose are heavy metals, lead, and chloride."

The corporations want nothing less than full control of the land, the end of normal animals so they can substitute patented genetically engineered ones, and the end of normal seeds and thus of seed banking by farmers or individuals.
And now Monsanto wants its own employee, Michael Taylor (the man who forced genetically engineered rBGH on the country when the Clintons placed him over ""food safety"" in the 90’s) back in government, this time to act with massive police power as a ""food safety tsar"".  HR 875 would give him immense power over what is done on every single farm in the country and massive police state power to wield over farmers.

Vitamin B12 is fittingly known as the energy vitamin, and your body requires it for a number of vital functions. Among them: energy production, blood formation, DNA synthesis, and myelin formation. Myelin is insulation that protects your nerve endings and allows them to communicate with one another.
If you know or suspect you're vitamin B12 deficient, you're not alone. Recent studies from the U.S. Framingham trial show one in four adults in the United States are deficient in this vitally important nutrient, and nearly half the population has suboptimal blood levels.

How You Get Vitamin B12 Deficient
Vitamin B12 is present in natural form only in animal sources of food, which is one of the reasons I advise against a strict vegetarian or vegan diet. There are many well-documented cases of blindness and brain abnormalities in strict vegetarians, resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency. 
The older you get the more likely you are to have a vitamin B12 deficiency. The two ways you become deficient are through a lack of vitamin B12 in your diet, or through your inability to absorb it from the food you eat.
I recently visited India, which is primarily a vegetarian based culture. Current studies there show about 80 percent of adults are deficient in vitamin B12.

Vegans and Vegetarians
Vitamin B12 deficiency is extremely common in strict vegetarians and vegans. B12 is not readily available in plants, so if you do not eat meat or animal products you are at risk.

Vitamin B12 is found almost exclusively in animal tissues, including foods like beef and beef liver, lamb, snapper, venison, salmon, shrimp, scallops, poultry and eggs.
The few plant foods that are sources of B12 are actually B12 analogs. An analog is a substance that blocks the uptake of true B12, so your body's need for the nutrient actually increases.
If you are not a vegan/vegetarian, and are including food sources of B12 in your diet and are still deficient in the vitamin, it is likely due to one of the reasons I'll discuss later in this report.

Why Vitamin B12 is So Important for Your Health
Vitamin B12, also known by the scientific name cobalamin, is water-soluble. Unlike other water-soluble vitamins, B12 doesn't exit your body quickly in urine. It is stored in your liver, kidneys and other body tissues. As a result, a deficiency may not show itself for a number of years, depending on your diet and your body's ability to efficiently absorb B12.
This time lag is a serious concern, because after about seven years of B12 deficiency, irreversible brain damage can result.
Vitamin B12 is a powerhouse micronutrient for a whole host of reasons. Your body needs B12 for:
proper digestion, food absorption, iron use, carbohydrate and fat metabolism
healthy nervous system function
promotion of normal nerve growth and development
help with regulation of the formation of red blood cells
cell formation and longevity
proper circulation
adrenal hormone production
healthy immune system function
support of female reproductive health and pregnancy
feelings of well-being and mood regulation
mental clarity, concentration, memory function
physical, emotional and mental energy
As you can see from this list, your B12 level impacts a number of very important systems in your body -- everything from your DNA to how happy you feel. If you think you might be deficient in this vitamin, you need to take steps to get your B12 levels into the healthy range.
I'll discuss the proper test to determine your B12 blood level as well as the latest information on what constitutes a healthy range a little later in this article.

Symptoms of Vitamin B12 Deficiency
If you don't have adequate vitamin B12 levels in your bloodstream, you might notice some of the following warning signs:
mental fogginess
problems with your memory
mood swings
lack of motivation
feelings of apathy
fatigue and a lack energy
muscle weakness
tingling in your extremities 
One of the most important functions of vitamin B12 is building the myelin which insulates and protects your nerve endings and allows them to communicate with one another.
If you're B12 deficient and your myelin is depleted, you can experience health problems as widespread as depression, dementia and even symptoms which mimic multiple sclerosis.

Depression
Depression is thought to be linked to a shortage of compounds called monoamines, which are manufactured by your central nervous system. Vitamin B12 helps your body make these compounds. There is also evidence high levels of homocysteine associated with B12 deficiency may promote depression.

Dementia and Alzheimer's
Research also indicates a B12 deficiency may lead to cognitive problems and reversible dementia in the elderly. This type of treatable dementia differs from Alzheimer's, however, B12 may play a role in this growing epidemic as well.
A study of over 100 senior volunteers showed older individuals with low levels of vitamin B12 are more apt to suffer from brain atrophy or shrinkage. Brain atrophy is a well-established characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

Anemia
A lack of vitamin B12 can result in a condition called pernicious anemia. Pernicious anemia is characterized by a lack of healthy red blood cells, and a larger size of existing cells.
Since vitamin B12 helps in the formation of red blood cells, a chronic lack of adequate B12 will naturally affect your body's ability to create red blood cells, eventually leading to anemia. ""Pernicious"" was the adjective applied to the often fatal condition back in the days before it was understood to be caused by a lack of vitamin B12.
Left untreated, pernicious anemia can do permanent, serious damage to your body. It can increase your risk for heart problems and strokes. It can damage your nerve cells and affect everything from your balance to your sense of smell. It can also cause changes to the surface of your digestive tract, increasing your risk of stomach cancer.

Sleep Problems
If you have trouble sleeping, it could be due to a lack of melatonin in your system. If you're a regular reader of my newsletter you know the importance I place on adequate good quality sleep for optimum health.
Melatonin is known as the ""sleep hormone"" and as you age, your body becomes less efficient at producing this chemical.
B12 plays a crucial role in melatonin production, which is another reason it is important to make sure you're receiving an adequate amount of this vitamin into your blood.

Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Conditions
Inadequate vitamin B12 levels have been linked to many neurological conditions in addition to dementia and Alzheimer's, including spinal cord disease and peripheral neuropathy.
Peripheral neuropathy is a disease or dysfunction of your peripheral nerves, and can include numbness and tremor, as well as opposite sensations like tingling, pain, itching and pins and needles. Your skin can become hypersensitive to the point where you can't stand to have anything touching certain areas of your body – clothing and bedding actually cause pain. If your muscles are involved they may feel weak, tired or heavy, and you may experience muscle cramps, tremors, and soreness.
A lack of vitamin B12 might also be implicated in migraine headaches and Parkinson's disease, both of which are neurological conditions.
Vitamin B12 deficiency has also been linked to psychiatric disorders, which are grouped into the following methods of expression:
Mood disturbances ... apathy, depression, eating abnormalities, and behavior disturbances which occur specifically at night
Hyperactivity ... agitation, euphoria, irritability, lack of inhibition, and motor disturbances
Psychosis ... hallucinations and delusions
Optic neuropathy is another outcome of vitamin B12 deficiency. Long-term, chronic B12 deficiency is known to cause deterioration of the optic nerves, resulting in blindness. This is an irreversible condition.

Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases
Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases have a common risk factor – increased homocysteine levels in blood.
Studies show insufficient amounts of folic acid and vitamin B12 can elevate your homocysteine levels, potentially increasing your risk for heart disease and stroke.

Cancer
We know vitamin B12 plays an important role in DNA synthesis, and its presence in your cells, along with folic acid, helps to alleviate the wear and tear on your genetic material. Damage to DNA is a well-known risk factor for cancer.
Low levels of B12 are specifically linked to increased risk for breast and cervical cancer.

How B12 Deficiency Affects Fertility, Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
Elevated homocysteine levels which result from an inadequate intake of B12 are well-known markers for increased risk of heart problems and stroke. Less known is the fact that high levels of homocysteine are also very dangerous during pregnancy and can lead to complications and birth defects.
Pregnant women with B12 deficiency carry an increased risk of having a baby born with neural tube defects, a class of birth defects affecting the infant's brain and spinal cord. Spina bifida, which can cause paralysis, is a type of neural tube defect, as is anencephaly, which is fatal.
If you're planning a pregnancy, it's absolutely critical to attain a healthy level of vitamin B12 in your blood stream before you conceive. Neural tube defects develop within the first four weeks of fetal life, so if you wait until you're pregnant to check your B12 levels, it could be too late.
If you've had trouble conceiving, or lost pregnancies through miscarriage, you should have your vitamin B12 levels checked. A B12 deficiency has been linked to infertility and repeated miscarriages.
If your diet doesn't include animal products and you're breastfeeding, your baby could develop brain abnormalities due to a vitamin B12 deficiency.
  Other Reasons You Can Become Deficient in Vitamin B12
  Age-Related Insufficient Production of Hydrochloric Acid
The older you get the more your digestive system breaks down, especially if you've been following the standard American diet. Specifically, the lining of your stomach gradually loses its ability to produce hydrochloric acid which releases vitamin B12 from your food.
If you're over 50, it's safe to assume you are not absorbing vitamin B12 at an optimal level.

Use of Antacids and Anti-Ulcer Drugs
The use of antacids or anti ulcer drugs will also lower your stomach acid secretion and decrease your ability to absorb vitamin B12.
Stomach acid (hydrochloric acid) is a crucial ingredient in your body's ability to absorb B12. If you're taking a medication specifically designed to reduce the amount of stomach acid you produce, your body's ability to use vitamin B12 from the food you eat or the supplements you take will be significantly compromised.

Use of the Drug Metformin©
If you take Metformin© (brand names Glucophage, Glucophage XR, Fortamet, Riomet, Glumetza, and others) for diabetes, the drug may reduce your B12 absorption through interference with the metabolism of calcium in your body. Calcium is another necessary component in your body's ability to absorb B12.
A recent study indicates that the longer a person with Type 2 diabetes takes Metformin© and the higher the dose, the greater the risk for vitamin B12 deficiency.

Use of Other Medications
Many prescription drugs have the potential to diminish the level of B12 in your system, including:
antibiotics antipsychotics
anti-cancer medications tuberculosis medications
anticonvulsants birth control pills
anti-gout medications cholesterol-lowering drugs
anti-hypertensives potassium replacements
drugs to treat Parkinson's disease  

Coffee Drinkers
According to recent research, if you drink four or more cups of coffee a day you are likely to experience a 15 percent reduction in B vitamins compared to people who don't drink coffee.

Bacterial Infection
Infection with Helicobacter pylori, a common contributor to stomach ulcers, can also result in vitamin B12 deficiency.
The H. pylori bacteria damage the cells of the stomach which produce intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is a crucial requirement for the absorption of vitamin B12 --I'll discuss its importance in more detail shortly.

Weight Loss Surgery Patients
If you've had gastric bypass surgery, you may be B12 deficient. The surgery often disrupts the mechanisms which aid your body in absorbing vitamin B12 and other vitamins.

Exposure to Nitrous Oxide (Laughing Gas Anesthesia)

There is ample evidence to indicate exposure to nitrous oxide may destroy B12 reserves.
Nitrous oxide is used by dentists for pain management and in operating rooms as a form of anesthesia. Use of the gas can pose a significant risk to those with existing undiagnosed or untreated B12 deficiency.
Health care workers who are routinely exposed to nitrous oxide are also at risk. And of grave concern is the abuse of the gas by medical personnel, teenagers and young adults who use it for its euphoric effects. This practice can result in severe neurological damage.

Food-Cobalamin Malabsorption Syndrome
The main cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is a term researchers call food-cobalamin malabsorption syndrome. (Remember cobalamin is the scientific term for vitamin B12.)
This condition typically results when your stomach lining loses its ability to produce intrinsic factor, which is a protein that binds to vitamin B12 and allows your body to absorb it into your bloodstream at the end of your small intestine.

The Fundamental Role of Intrinsic Factor in Vitamin B12 Absorption
The key point to understand here is that if your body is not making intrinsic factor, you could swallow vitamin B12 till the cows come home and you simply won't absorb it.
Part of the reason you require a binding protein like intrinsic factor is that vitamin B12 is a very large molecule. It is actually the largest vitamin we know of. In addition, the way it gets absorbed into your body involves a complex series of events.
Intrinsic factor is a molecule protein made by your stomach. It grabs onto the B12 molecule and together they move through your stomach to your small intestine. When they reach the end of your small intestine, the intrinsic factor is absorbed first, pulling the B12 with it into the cells of your large intestine, where they are absorbed for use by the rest of your body.
 


Cobalamin (cbl) absorption and metabolic pathway.
(A)   Structure of cobalamin (vitamin B12) with a corrin ring bound to a central cobalt atom.
(B)   The metabolic journey of cbl from nutrient intake to its intestinal absorption. Endocytic receptors and proteins responsible for vitamin B12 intestinal absorption include cubilin (CUBN), amnionless (AMN), receptor-associated protein (RAP) and megalin (LRP-2). The membrane megalin/transcobalamin II (TCII) receptor complex allows the cellular uptake of cbl. Lysosomal-mediated degradation of TCII and subsequent release of free cbl is essential for vitamin B12 metabolic functions. MS: methonine synthase; THF: tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR: methyltetrahydrofolate reductase; MCM: methylmalonyl coA mutase.
(C)Mutations in genes encoding the IF (GIF), CUBN, AMN, TCII or its receptor provoke defects in cbl absorption and/or cellular uptake which translates into functional cbl deficiency and its clinical manifestations.
If your body doesn't produce enough stomach acid, then you're not producing enough intrinsic factor either.
Indigestion, heartburn and gastric reflux disease (GERD) are conditions which normally develop later in life. While symptoms feel like your stomach is making too much acid, in the vast majority of cases, the reverse is true – too little stomach acid is being produced.
To make matters worse, the first thing many people do when they get symptoms of indigestion or heartburn is reach for an antacid, further compromising their ability to produce hydrochloric acid.
Lack of free acid in your stomach interferes with digestion and reduces the amount of nutrients you get from the food you eat.
Since a lack of stomach acid means a lack of intrinsic factor, and since the only way vitamin B12 can be absorbed into your system is through bonding with intrinsic factor molecules, it's easy to understand why so many people are not getting adequate B12 into their bodies.
This is why vitamin B12 shots are so popular. They bypass absorption problems and put the vitamin directly into your bloodstream.

Testing for B12 Deficiency
Blood tests for vitamin B12 deficiency aren't as clear cut or helpful as they are for other nutritional deficiencies. Standard tests to assess vitamin B12 concentrations are limited because the clinical severity of vitamin B12 deficiency is unrelated to vitamin B12 concentrations.
Researchers have established the following recommendations to screen for vitamin B12 deficiency:
If your vitamin B12 concentration is less than 150 pmol/L, you are considered B12 deficient and you and your health care practitioner should take steps to determine the underlying cause(s) and treatment.
If your B12 concentration is between 150 and 200 pmol/L, your serum MMA (Methylmalonic Acid) level should be determined to identify whether your situation requires more investigation and treatment. Research suggests elevated levels of MMA (a natural compound found in your body) are an indicator for vitamin B12 deficiency.
Getting your B12 and MMA serum levels lab tested is one way to go, especially if you have a compelling reason to have ""official"" test results.
However, it is probably a more practical approach if you suspect or are concerned you are vitamin B12 deficient, to simply supplement your diet with B12 and see if your symptoms improve.
Vitamin B12 supplementation is completely non-toxic and inexpensive, especially when compared to the cost of laboratory testing. In fact, the first treatment most doctors and other health care experts will suggest upon receiving B12 deficiency lab test results is supplementation with vitamin B12. So again, it is an entirely reasonable approach to try supplementation first to see if your symptoms improve.

Natural Sources of Vitamin B12
One of the best natural sources for vitamin B12 is certain types of seafood. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to buy commercially produced un-contaminated fish, and it is my firm belief the risks associated with mercury laden seafood outweigh its health benefits.
I do not recommend eating most commercially available fish, as it is just too difficult to determine its purity and safety. This is especially true if you're pregnant or have a growing family, as methyl mercury is highly toxic to the developing brains and nervous systems of infants and children.
Beef and beef liver are also good sources of B12, but keep in mind grass-fed beef is highly preferable to the grain-fed variety.
Chicken is also a natural source of vitamin B12. Organic chicken is the way to go, as conventionally raised chickens may harbor antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.
Pork is another source of vitamin B12. It is not a food I recommend, however. Pigs are scavengers and will eat almost anything, making them susceptible to retroviruses and parasites. These bugs have a high probability of making it into pork food supplies, and no amount of cooking can insure they have been killed.
If you must eat pork, your safest bet is to eat the meat of non farm-raised animals, fed organically. However, you should avoid all processed pork products like bacon and sausage.
Regardless of which meat you prefer, keep in mind -- how it is cooked can also mean the difference between a nutritious meal and an unhealthy one.
Drinking milk is another way to get vitamin B12. However, avoid pasteurized milk even if it's organic. The only milk I recommend is raw milk. Look for Certified Grade A milk, produced under government supervision and guaranteed absolutely clean.
Eggs are another source of vitamin B12, and there's a bonus: eggs are one of the healthiest all-around foods in the world.
Ideally you'll be able to buy your eggs locally from a free-range pasture farm. Second choice would be to buy free-range organic from the grocery store. Don't go for the omega-3 added eggs – they are actually less healthy for you than regular eggs.
As with all foods, how you prepare your eggs makes a big difference in their nutritional value. I recommend eating eggs raw, however, if you choose to cook them, soft-boiling is your next best option. Scrambling is the least desirable of all cooking methods, especially if you have high cholesterol.

A Word about Vitamin B12 Fortified Breakfast Cereals
In doing your research on food sources of vitamin B12, you'll likely find vitamin fortified breakfast cereals on most mainstream lists. I completely disagree with this recommendation.
Vitamin fortified or not, cereals are not a healthy food. The highly processed grains in cereals quickly break down to sugar in your system, and stimulate insulin production. Infants and children also do not fare well eating cereal.

Supplementation: Science Develops a Better Way to Replenish Your B12 Stores
Part of the reason vitamin B12 is so difficult to absorb and requires an additional protein is because it is a massively large molecule when compared with the other vitamins. It is far larger than any other vitamin and requires extraordinary measures to actually push this molecule into your blood.
Since the primary challenge your body faces in absorbing vitamin B12 is the large size of the molecule, a B12 delivery system which shrinks the molecules makes perfect sense.
Science has recently developed a technology that can reduce the effective size of the vitamin B12 molecule and help you absorb this molecule into the fine capillaries under your tongue. The delivery system for these microscopic droplets of vitamin B12 is a fine mist you spray into your mouth.
This delivery system bypasses the intrinsic factor problem and is much easier, safer and less painful than a vitamin B12 shot.

Next Steps
Vitamin B12 deficiency is a potentially life-threatening condition. A best case scenario if you're B12 deficient is you aren't in optimal good health, which is always the goal.
To review, if you fall into one of the following categories, you should investigate whether you are B12 deficient:
You are a vegan or vegetarian
You are over 50
You take antacids or anti-ulcer medication
You take Metformin© for diabetes
You take other prescription drugs known to deplete your B12 stores (see list above)
You drink four or more cups a coffee a day
You have or had an H. pylori bacterial infection
You've had weight loss surgery
You've been exposed to nitrous oxide (laughing gas)
You suffer from indigestion, heartburn or GERD
Symptoms or warning signs of a possible B12 deficiency include:
Mental fogginess or problems with your memory
Mood swings, a feeling of apathy or lack of motivation
Fatigue, a lack of energy, muscle weakness, tingling in your arms or legs
If you aren't getting sufficient B12 in your diet, or you suspect your body isn't able to efficiently absorb the vitamin, I recommend you begin supplementation immediately with either an under-the-tongue fine mist spray or vitamin B12 injections.
Ensuring your body has adequate B12 can vastly improve the quality of your life today, and prevent debilitating, even life-threatening diseases which result from a deficiency of this all-important nutrient.

The fructose group also had higher total cholesterol and LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, and greater insulin resistance."

It is amazing how the little twists and turns of researchers can have such a profound impact on what we generally come to realize as “scientific truth.” Let me share a recent fascinating example of how this impacted one of the most powerful hormones in your body.
The Ob mouse is a strain of mouse that has a genetic mutation that makes it obese and unhealthy. It has been used for many years as a model of obesity to do research on, though the reason that it was obese had eluded scientists.
This changed when, in 1994, Jeffrey Friedman discovered that this mouse lacked a previously unknown hormone called leptin, and when it was injected with leptin it became thin, vibrant, and very healthy within weeks. This made headlines around the world, ""the cure for obesity found"" and pharmaceutical companies started tripping over themselves with trillion dollar signs in their eyes to be the first to genetically manufacture leptin on a large-scale.
This did not last long. When people were tested for leptin, it was found that, unlike the Ob mouse, they did not lack leptin; on the contrary almost all overweight and obese people have excess leptin.
These people were ""leptin resistant"" and giving extra leptin did little good.
The financial disappointment was extreme and scientists working for pharmaceutical companies said that leptin wasn't important anymore since they could not find a drug to control it, and therefore the industry couldn't make money on it. To make big money in medicine one needs a patent and this generally means remedies which are not commonly or easily available -- that are not natural.
This illustrates two extremely unfortunate principles in modern medicine; only those therapies that will make lots of money (generally for the pharmaceutical industry or hospitals), ever get pursued and then taught to physicians (since most of medical education after medical school takes place by drug reps), and these therapies, almost by definition, will be unnatural.
This inhibition of extremely important knowledge is not only unfortunate, it is deadly, and is exemplified by how few people, including doctors, know anything about leptin, though I would consider it to be the most important chemical in your body that will determine your health and lifespan.
Two Hormones that are Vital for Optimal Health
Each and every one of us is a combination of lives within lives. We are made up of trillions of individual living cells that each must maintain itself. Even more significantly, the cells must communicate and interact with each other to form a republic of cells that we call our individual self.
Our health and life depends on how accurately instructions are conveyed to our cells so that they can act in harmony. It is the communication among the individual cells that will determine our health and our life.
The communication takes place by hormones. Arguably therefore, the most important molecules in your body that ultimately will decide your health and life are hormones.
Many would say that genes and chromosomes are the most important molecules, however once born your genes pretty much just sit there; hormones tell them what to do. Certainly, the most important message that our cells receive is how and what to do with energy, and therefore life cannot take place without that.
The two most important hormones that deliver messages about energy and metabolism are insulin and leptin.
Metabolism can roughly be defined as the chemistry that turns food into life, and therefore insulin and leptin are critical to health and disease. Both insulin and leptin work together to control the quality of your metabolism (and, to a significant extent, the rate of metabolism).
Insulin works mostly at the individual cell level, telling the vast majority of cells whether to burn or store fat or sugar and whether to utilize that energy for maintenance and repair or reproduction. This is extremely important as we shall see, for on an individual cell level turning on maintenance and repair equates to increased longevity, and turning up cellular reproduction can increase your risk of cancer.
Leptin, on the other hand, controls the energy storage and utilization of the entire republic of cells allowing the body to communicate with the brain about how much energy (fat) the republic has stored, and whether it needs more, or should burn some off, and whether it is an advantageous time nutritionally-speaking for the republic --you-- to reproduce or not.
What Exactly is Leptin?
Leptin is a very powerful and influential hormone produced by fat cells that has totally changed the way that science (real science, outside of medicine) looks at fat, nutrition, and metabolism in general.
Prior to leptin's discovery, fat was viewed as strictly an ugly energy storage depot that most everyone was trying to get rid of. After it was discovered that fat produced the hormone leptin (and subsequently it was discovered that fat produced other very significant hormones), fat became an endocrine organ like the ovaries, pancreas and pituitary, influencing the rest of the body and, in particular, the brain.
Leptin, as far  as science currently knows, is the most powerful regulator that tells your brain what to do about life's two main biological goals: eating and reproduction. Your fat, by way of leptin, tells your brain whether you should be hungry, eat and make more fat, whether you should reproduce and make babies, or (partly by controlling insulin) whether to ""hunker down"" and work overtime to maintain and repair yourself.
I believe I could now make a very convincing and scientifically accurate statement that that rather than your brain being in control of the rest of your body, your brain is, in fact, subservient to your fat -- and leptin.
In short, leptin is the way that your fat stores speak to your brain to let your brain know how much energy is available and, very importantly, what to do with it. Therefore, leptin may be ""on top of the food chain"" in metabolic importance and relevance to disease.
How Leptin Regulates Your Weight
It has been known for many years that fat stores are highly regulated. It appeared that when one tried to lose weight the body would try to gain it back. This commonly results in ""yo-yo"" dieting and in scientific circles one talks about the ""set point"" of weight. It has long been theorized that there must be a hormone that determines this.
Science points now to leptin as being that hormone.
In our ancestral history, it was advantageous to store some fat to call upon during times of famine. However, it was equally disadvantageous to be too fat. For most of our evolutionary history, it was necessary to run, to obtain prey and perhaps most importantly, to avoid being prey. If a lion was chasing a group of people it would most likely catch and eliminate from the gene pool the slowest runner and the one who could not make it up the tree -- the fattest one.
Thus, fat storage had to be highly regulated and this is done, as is any regulation, through hormones, the most significant being leptin.
If a person is getting too fat, the extra fat produces more leptin which is supposed to tell the brain that there is too much fat stored, more should not be stored, and the excess should be burned.
Signals are therefore sent to an area of the brain in the hypothalamus (the arcuate nucleus) to stop being hungry, to stop eating, to stop storing fat and to start burning some extra fat off.
Controlling hunger is a major (though not the only) way that leptin controls energy storage. Hunger is a very powerful, ancient, and deep-seated drive that, if stimulated long enough, will make you eat and store more energy. Asking somebody to not eat, to voluntarily restrict calories even though they are hungry, is asking the near impossible. The only way to eat less in the long-term is to not be hungry, and the only way to do this is to control the hormones that regulate hunger, the primary one being leptin.
How Leptin Resistance Leads to Disease
More recently, it has been found that leptin not only changes brain chemistry, but can also ""rewire"" the very important areas of the brain that control hunger and metabolism. I'm not aware of any other chemical in the body that has been shown to accomplish this ""mind bending"" event.
This has really caught the attention of the scientific community. Further studies have now shown that leptin, or more correctly the inability of the body to properly hear leptin’s signals, in other words leptin resistance, plays significant if not primary roles in heart disease, obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, reproductive disorders, and perhaps the rate of aging itself.
It helps to control the brain areas that regulate thyroid levels and the sympathetic nervous system which also has huge impacts on blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and aging. Leptin's stimulatory effect on the sympathetic nervous system also helps determine the adrenal stress response including cortisol levels.
Leptin May Be Even More Critical Than Insulin
The importance of insulin in health and disease is becoming well-known. Aside from its obvious role in diabetes, it plays a very significant role in hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
I was one of the first to speak publicly to doctors about insulin’s critical role in health well over a decade ago (see the transcribed talk Insulin and its Metabolic Effects) and I am even more convinced now.
However leptin may even supersede insulin in importance, for new research is revealing that in the long run glucose and therefore insulin levels may be largely determined by leptin.
It had been previously believed that the insulin sensitivity of muscle and fat tissues were the most important factor in determining whether one would become diabetic or not. Elegant new studies are showing that the brain and liver are most important in regulating a person’s blood sugar levels especially in type 2 or insulin resistant diabetes.
It should be noted again that leptin plays a vital role in regulating your brain’s hypothalamic activity which in turn regulates much of a person’s ""autonomic"" functions; those functions that you don't necessarily think about but which determines much of your life (and health) such as body temperature, heart rate, hunger, the stress response, fat burning or storage, reproductive behavior, and newly discovered roles in bone growth and blood sugar levels.
Another very recent study reveals leptin's importance in directly regulating how much sugar that the liver manufactures via gluconeogenesis.
Many chronic diseases are now linked to excess inflammation such as heart disease and diabetes. High leptin levels are very pro-inflammatory, and leptin also helps to mediate the manufacture of other very potent inflammatory chemicals from fat cells that also play a significant role in the progression of heart disease and diabetes. It has long been known that obesity greatly increased risk for many chronic diseases including heart disease and diabetes, but no one really knew why.
Leptin appears to be the missing link.
Could Leptin Also Affect  How Fast You Age?
Leptin will not only determine how much fat you have, but also where that fat is put. When you are leptin resistant you put that fat mostly in your belly, your viscera, causing the so-called ""apple shape"" that is linked to much disease. Some of that fat permeates the liver, impeding the liver's ability to listen to insulin, and further hastening diabetes.
  Leptin plays a far more important role in your health than, for instance, cholesterol, yet how many doctors measure leptin levels in their patients, know their own level, even know that it can be easily measured, or even what it would mean?
Leptin appears to play a significant role in obesity, heart disease, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. These are the so-called ""chronic diseases of aging"".
Could it perhaps affect the rate of aging itself?
The Biology of Aging
Scientists who study the biology of aging are beginning to look at that question. There are two endeavors, two drives that life has been programmed, since its inception, to succeed at and to succumb to. These are to eat and to reproduce.
If every one of our ancestors had not succeeded in eating and reproducing we would not be here, and this paper would be moot. All of your morphological characteristics from your hair to your toenails are designed to help you succeed at those two activities. That is what nature wants us to do. Nature's purpose is not necessarily to have you live a long and healthy life, but to perpetuate the instructions, the genes that tell how to perpetuate life.
Even so-called ""paleolithic"" diets, though undoubtedly far better than what is generally eaten today, were not necessarily designed by nature to help us live a long and healthy life but, at best, to maximize reproduction. Nature appears to not care much about what happens to us after we have had a sufficient chance to reproduce. That is why we die.
But there are clues as to how to live a long and healthy life. And that brings us once again to fat--and leptin.
It takes energy to make babies; lots of it. Energy was and always will be a coveted commodity. Nature, and evolution, hates wasting it. It makes no sense to try and make babies when it appears that there's not enough energy available to successfully accomplish that goal.
Instead, it seems that virtually all living forms can ""switch gears"" and direct energy away from reproduction and towards mechanism that will allow it to ""hunker down"" for the long haul and thus be able to reproduce at a future more nutritionally opportune time. In other words nature will then let you live longer to accomplish its primary directive of reproduction.
It does this by up regulating maintenance and repair genes that increase production of intracellular antioxidant systems, heat shock proteins (that help maintain protein shape), and DNA repair enzymes. This is what happens when you restrict calories (without starvation) in animals, and that has been shown convincingly for 70 years to greatly extend the life span of many dozens of species. Thus, there is a powerful link between reproduction, energy stores, and longevity.
Genetic studies in simple organisms have shown that that link is at least partially mediated by insulin (which in simple organisms also functions as a growth hormone), and that when insulin signals are kept low, indicating scarce energy availability, maximal lifespan can be extended--- a lot; several hundred percent in worms and flies.
Glucose is an ancient fuel used even before there was oxygen in the atmosphere, for life can burn glucose without oxygen; it is an anaerobic fuel. The use of fat as fuel came later, after life in the form of plants soaked the earth in oxygen, for you cannot burn fat without oxygen.
The primary source of energy stores in people by far is fat, as many unfortunately are all too aware of. The primary signal that indicates how much fat is stored is leptin, and it is also leptin that allows for reproduction, or not.
It has long been known that women with very little body fat, such as marathon runners, stop ovulating. There is not enough leptin being produced to permit it. Paradoxically, the first pharmaceutical use of leptin was recently approved to give to skinny women to allow them to reproduce.
Leptin’s Role in Improving Your Metabolism
Leptin also is instrumental in regulating body temperature, partly by controlling the rate of metabolism via its regulation of the thyroid.
  Metabolic rate and temperature has long been connected with longevity. Almost all mechanisms that extend lifespan in many different organisms result in lower temperature. Flowers are refrigerated at the florist to extend their lifespan. Restricting calories in animals also results in lower temperature, reduced thyroid levels, and longer life.
  It should be noted that reduced thyroid levels in this case are not synonymous with hypothyroidism. Here, the body is choosing to lower thyroid hormones because the increased efficiency of energy use and hormonal signaling (including perhaps thyroid) is allowing this to happen.
Anything will dissolve faster in hot water than cold water. Extra heat will dissolve, disrupt and disorganize. This is not what I try to do to make someone healthy. It is commonly advised to ""increase metabolism"" and increase ""thermogenesis"" for health and weight loss.
Yet how many of you would put a brand of gasoline in your car that advertised that it would make your engine run hotter? What would that do to the life of your car? It is not an increase in metabolism that I am after; it is improved metabolic quality.
That will be determined at the quality of your leptin signaling.
If it is poor, if you are insulin and leptin resistant, your metabolism is unhealthy and high in what I call ""metabolic friction"". If you then increase its rate you will likely accelerate your demise. To increase the quality of your metabolism you must be able to properly listen to insulin and especially to leptin.
If your fasting blood serum level of leptin is elevated you are likely leptin resistant and you will not be healthy unless you correct it.
How Do You Become Leptin Resistant?
This is the subject of much research. I believe people become leptin-resistant by the same general mechanism that people become insulin-resistant; by overexposure to high levels of the hormone.
High blood glucose levels cause repeated surges in insulin, and this causes one's cells to become ""insulin-resistant"" which leads to further high levels of insulin and diabetes. It is much the same as being in a smelly room for a period of time. Soon, you stop being able to smell it, because the signal no longer gets through.
I believe the same happens with leptin. It has been shown that as sugar gets metabolized in fat cells, fat releases surges in leptin, and I believe that those surges result in leptin-resistance just as it results in insulin-resistance.
The only known way to reestablish proper leptin (and insulin) signaling is to prevent those surges, and the only known way to do that is via diet and supplements.
As such, these can have a more profound effect on your health than any other known modality of medical treatment.
When leptin signaling is restored, your brain can finally hear the message that perhaps should have been delivered decades ago; high leptin levels can now scream to your brain that you have too much fat and that you better start burning some off for your life is in danger.
Your brain will finally allow you access into your pantry that you have been storing your fat in. Your cells will be fed the food from that fat and they will be satisfied. They will not know whether that food came from your belly fat or from your mouth; nor will they care. They will be receiving energy that they need and will not have to ask for more. You will not be hungry.
This also makes counting calories irrelevant, for the calories that you put into your mouth today are not necessarily what your cells will be eating; that will be determined primarily by leptin. Whether or not you put food into your mouth, your cells will be eating, and if they cannot eat fat they must eat sugar.
Since little sugar is stored, that sugar will be had by making you crave it, or by turning the protein in your muscle and bone into sugar. This contributes in a major way to weakness and osteoporosis. Whether or not this lean tissue wasting happens is determined by your capacity, or incapacity, to burn fat, and that is determined by your ability to listen to leptin.
A strategic diet that emphasizes good fats and avoids blood sugar spikes coupled with targeted supplements (as recommended in my Rosedale Diet and Dr. Mercola’s Take Control of Your Health), will enhance insulin and leptin sensitivity so that you can once again hear their music, allowing your life to be the symphony it was meant to be."

  The FDA used to be the world’s gold standard health regulator.  However, it has recently spiraled into a Byzantine phalanx of independent centers providing hasty approvals of high-risk products, without oversight, and inconsistent regulations.
 
A powerful example is its regulation of mercury amalgam fillings.  The FDA has done nothing until compelled to act by court order.
  To be FDA’s new Commissioner, President Obama chose former New York City Health Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, M.D.  The Harvard-educated physician was confirmed May 18th  without controversy or opposition.
  The FDA Protects Animals from Mercury but Not Humans
A good way for Dr. Hamburg to begin would be to reverse years of FDA inaction on mercury amalgam – a step she assured Senator Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) she would take in response to his question during the confirmation process.  Inexplicably, the FDA zealously protects animals from mercury exposure, while taking almost a laissez-faire approach to human exposure to mercury. 
  In 2002, the agency pulled from the market a mercury-containing ointment for horses, and proclaimed zero tolerance for mercury in any product used to treat an animal.  The FDA ruled that mercury is so toxic to mammals, it had no duty to prove its presence actually harms horses. 
  When it comes to mercury-containing products marketed to the humans however the FDA’s zeal evaporates.  The FDA requires  mercury critics to prove actual and widespread harm -- the shocking opposite of its position on protecting animals.  Interestingly, the FDA policies ignore warnings from the Environmental Protection Agency that one in seven American women of childbearing age has so much mercury she is at risk of having a brain-damaged child. 
  Mercury Amalgams (Silver Fillings) Are Archaic, Deceptive, and Dangerous 
Nowhere is the FDA’s failure to protect humans from mercury more blatant than in the field of dentistry.  Amalgam fillings are 19th century devices containing 50% mercury. 

However, the FDA continues to allow unregulated amalgam use in assembly-line clinics and institutions – including, sadly, the military – despite the fact that modern dentists have switched to safer alternatives like resin.  A national dentist poll published in the June edition of The Wealthy Dentist states that slightly over 50% of dentists are mercury-free, meaning the 19th-century-style dentists – the mercury-users – have declined to less than half of all US dentists!   
The FDA never even acted to stop use of the deceptive term “silver fillings” to describe amalgam.  As a result, a Zogby poll conducted three years ago found that more than three in four Americans could not name mercury as amalgam’s main component. 

FDA Successfully Sued
I run a small national consumer group, and have sparred with the FDA for seven years, first coaxing, then suing, to get the agency to do what is legally required.  After my organization, Consumers for Dental Choice, sued the FDA, the agency retracted its claims of amalgam’s safety from its website and issued a stark advisory:  Mercury from amalgam fillings  “may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses.”   
  As a result of my lawsuit against the FDA it must, by court order,  classify amalgam – that is, issue a regulation deciding the degree of risk it poses for the general public and for vulnerable subpopulations – by July 28, 2009.  In anticipation, public officials are imploring the FDA to protect dental consumers. 
  The State and Local Public Officials Mercury-Free Caucus, a coalition of state lawmakers, mayors, and other public officials from eleven states, wrote a letter asking that FDA “act decisively to protect Americans, especially children and young women, from mercury by limiting, then phasing out the use of amalgam.”    
  Then, on May 14, Congresswoman Diane Watson (D-Calif.) and Congressman Dan Burton (R-Ind.) sent a letter urging the FDA to steer consumers to safer materials.  Co-signed by 17 other Members of Congress, it emphasizes that mercury from amalgam can “threaten the development of the fetus” and “pass into breast milk of the lactating mothers.”  Thus, the FDA must not only ensure that all consumers know about the mercury, but the FDA must also “protect women and children from the harmful effects of mercury fillings.”   
  The End of Silver Fillings May Be Near!
  As the FDA approaches its duty to classify, manufacturers and pro-mercury dentists are increasingly feeling the heat.  In May, a religious-consumer-environmental coalition, led by Sister Valerie Heinonen, Ursuline Sisters of Tildonk, presented a resolution to the annual meeting of Danaher, the #1 manufacturer of toxic mercury fillings.  Calling for Danaher to consider exiting amalgam, one-sixth of all shareholders (forty-three million shares) voted for it, an extraordinary outcome for a first-time presentation. 
  But it isn’t just activists weighing in – it’s Wall Street itself.  A financial analysis by Bank of America Securities advises that Dentsply, the #2 manufacturer, would be more profitable if mercury fillings are banned. And where manufacturer liability looms, the trial lawyers won’t be far behind.  My article in the Idaho Trial Lawyers Association Journal provides a preliminary road map for such litigation.  
  An industry analysis by J.P. Morgan predicts that the FDA will finally stop mercury amalgam fillings from going to children and pregnant women.  It’s about time.  The Canadian government took this action thirteen years ago.  
  You Can Make a Difference
  For all players, the upcoming FDA rule on July 18, 2009 will mark the watershed moment in dental history. 
  For the average person, it means empowerment, access to the information we need to reject mercury fillings – and switch to mercury-free dentists.
  For the bitter-ender pro-mercury dentists, as represented by the American Dental Association, it means the chance to recognize that the FDA’s rule will mark the beginning of the end of mercury fillings – or surely these dentists and their trade group will fall on their collective swords for toxic mercury.
  For the Obama Administration’s FDA, it means the first and best opportunity to return to the path toward becoming the world gold standard health regulator.

An increasing number of studies link these risk factors with vitamin D deficiency. Dr. William B. Grant of the Sunlight, Nutrition, and Health Research Center (SUNARC) suggests that further investigation of possible direct or indirect linkages between vitamin D and these dementias are needed.
Low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D have been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, depression, dental caries, osteoporosis, and periodontal disease, all of which are either considered risk factors for dementia or have preceded incidence of dementia.
For example, several studies have correlated tooth loss with development of cognitive impairment. There are two primary ways that people lose teeth: dental caries and periodontal disease. Both conditions are linked to low vitamin D levels.
Additionally, as reported by Reuters, low levels of vitamin D are also associated with the loss of cartilage in the knee joint of older individuals. Cartilage loss is the hallmark of osteoarthritis.
The researchers found that osteoarthritis patients with vitamin D sufficiency have approximately 1.5 percent less loss of knee cartilage per year than patients with vitamin D deficiency. The investigators measured the levels of vitamin D in blood samples, as well as the knee cartilage volume on X-rays, of nearly 900 men and women. The team then took similar measurements again almost three years later for about 350 of the study participants.
Overall, 58 percent of these subjects showed changes in knee cartilage indicating worsening osteoarthritis. But both at the beginning of the study enrollment and at follow up, men and women with vitamin D deficiency had lower knee cartilage volume and were more likely to experience knee pain.
Vitamin D Dose Recommendations
Age Dosage
Below 5 35 units per pound per day
Age 5 - 10 2500 units
Age 18 - 30 5000 units
Pregnant Women 5000 units
WARNING: There is no way to know if the above recommendations are correct. The ONLY way to know is to test your blood. You might need 4-5 times the amount recommended above. Ideally your blood level of 25 OH D should be 60ng/ml.
  Vitamin D was once linked to only bone diseases such as rickets and osteoporosis but now is recognized as a major player in overall human health.
One of the most exciting benefits of vitamin D that is still being uncovered is its impact on your brain. As Dr. William Grant, one of the top vitamin D researchers in the world, pointed out, observational studies support a beneficial role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of diseases linked to dementia, such as vascular and metabolic diseases, as well as an understanding of the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of several factors that lead to dementia.
How Might Vitamin D Benefit Your Brain … and Alzheimer’s Disease?
Scientists are beginning to realize vitamin D is involved in maintaining the health of your brain, as they’ve recently discovered vitamin D receptors in your brain, spinal cord, and central nervous system. (In fact, there are 36 organ tissues in your body whose cells respond biologically to vitamin D, including bone marrow, breast, colon, intestine, kidney, lung, prostate, retina, skin, stomach and uterine tissues.)
There are actually only 30,000 genes in your body and vitamin D has been shown to influence over 2,000 of them. That is one of the primary reasons it influences so many diseases from cancer and autism to depression and asthma.
But getting back to its role in brain health, in 2007 researchers at the University of Wisconsin uncovered strong links between low levels of vitamin D in Alzheimer's patients and poor outcomes on cognitive tests.
Scientists launched the study after family members of Alzheimer's patients who were treated with large doses of prescription vitamin D reported that they were acting and performing better than before.
Researchers believe that optimal vitamin D levels may enhance the amount of important chemicals in your brain and protect brain cells.
Just recently researchers from the University of Manchester also found that getting more vitamin D helps elderly people stay mentally fit. Researchers compared the cognitive performance of more than 3,000 men aged 40 to 79, and found those with low vitamin D levels performed less well on a task designed to test mental agility.
Further, the brain benefits of vitamin D have also been described in several experimental models, indicating the potential value of vitamin D in helping neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases. In addition, vitamin D induces glioma (a type of tumor) cell death, making the hormone of potential interest in the management of brain tumors.
There’s even evidence indicating vitamin D improves your brain’s detoxification process. For children and pregnant women, getting enough vitamin D is therefore especially crucial, as it may play a major role in protecting infants' brains from autism.
Even More Benefits of Vitamin D
The second study mentioned in the above article found a promising link for the role of vitamin D in helping to prevent knee osteoarthritis (a degenerative joint disease).
Those in the study with vitamin D deficiency had lower knee cartilage volume and were more likely to experience knee pain. It’s thought that vitamin D plays an important role in cartilage changes, and vitamin D deficiency may predict knee cartilage loss over time.
So if you are currently struggling with knee pain, joint pain or osteoarthritis, adding regular sun exposure to your lifestyle, and supplementing with a high-quality source of vitamin D when this is not possible, may help.
The Best Source of Vitamin D, and What Level You Need to Stay Healthy
Exposing your skin to sunlight is the best way to get vitamin D.
Sun exposure (without sunscreen) until your skin turns the lightest shade of pink is a general guide of how much you need. For some, this will be about 10 to 15 minutes a day, with at least 40 percent of your skin exposed, although people with dark skin will need to stay out significantly longer. Please read this past article for a list of safe tanning guidelines.
If you’re able to get out in the sun for an adequate time period each day, your vitamin D levels should be naturally optimized.
However, most of us have days during which we may not be able to get enough sun exposure, either due to weather or time constraints. In that case, I also advise using a safe tanning bed (one that has the harmful emissions shielded) to have your own body produce vitamin D naturally.
A third option is taking a high-quality vitamin D supplement. The most important thing to keep in mind if you opt for oral supplementation is that you only want to supplement with natural vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), which is human vitamin D. Do NOT use the synthetic and highly inferior vitamin D2.
How do you know if you’re getting the right amount of vitamin D?
You need to have your blood levels tested, but not just any test -- or any lab -- will do.
I’ve discussed exactly what you need to know to get the right vitamin D test, with accurate results, here. The OPTIMAL level of vitamin D you’re looking for is 50-65 ng/ml.

More Natural Tips for Preventing Alzheimer’s Disease
Given that approximately 10 million American baby boomers will develop Alzheimer‘s disease in their lifetime, and by 2010 there will be 500,000 new cases each year, starting on prevention strategies now is of utmost importance.
These simple lifestyle changes can help keep your brain in optimal working order now and as you get older.
Optimize your vitamin D levels through safe sun exposure, a safe tanning bed and/or vitamin D supplements.
Eat a nutritious diet with plenty of vegetables based on your nutritional type, and pay special attention to avoiding sugar.
Eat plenty of high-quality, animal-based omega-3 fats in the form of krill oil. Avoid most fish (high in omega-3, but often contaminated with mercury).
Avoid and remove mercury from your body. Dental amalgam fillings are one of the major sources of mercury, however you should be healthy prior to having them removed. Once you have adjusted to following the diet described in Take Control of Your Health, you can follow the mercury detox protocol and then find a qualified biological dentist to have your amalgams removed.
(Be sure to only use a high-quality biologically trained dentist who is familiar with the removal of amalgam fillings or your health could get ruined.)
Avoid aluminum, such as in antiperspirants, cookware, etc.
Exercise for three to five hours per week. According to one study, the odds of developing Alzheimer's were nearly quadrupled in people who were less active during their leisure time, between the ages of 20 and 60, compared with their peers.
Avoid flu vaccinations as they contain both mercury and aluminum!
Wild blueberries, which have high anthocyanin and antioxidant content, are known to guard against Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases.
Challenge your mind daily. Mental stimulation, such as traveling, learning to play an instrument or doing crossword puzzles, is associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's. Researchers suspect that mental challenge helps to build up your brain, making it less susceptible to the lesions associated with Alzheimer's disease."

The model, dubbed DINOMIT, differs from the older model of cancer development, which suggests genetic mutations as the earliest driving forces behind cancer.
""The first event in cancer is loss of communication among cells due to, among other things, low vitamin D and calcium levels,"" said epidemiologist Cedric Garland. ""This loss may play a key role in cancer by disrupting the communication between cells that is essential to healthy cell turnover, allowing more aggressive cancer cells to take over.""
Garland suggests that such cellular disruption could account for the earliest stages of many cancers. Previous theories linking vitamin D to certain cancers have been tested and confirmed in more than 200 epidemiological studies, and understanding of its physiological basis stems from more than 2,500 laboratory studies.
Each letter in DINOMIT stands for a different phase of cancer development – disjunction, initiation, natural selection, overgrowth of cells, metastasis, involution, and transition.
While there is not yet definitive scientific proof, Garland suggests that much of the evolutionary process in cancer could be arrested at the outset by maintaining adequate vitamin D levels.
According to another study, getting more of the ""sunshine vitamin"" may also help you stay mentally fit as you age.
Researchers compared the cognitive performance of more than 3,000 men aged 40 to 79, and found those with low vitamin D levels performed less well on a task designed to test mental agility. The findings are some of the strongest evidence yet of such a link, because of the size of the study and because the researchers adjusted for a number of lifestyle factors believed to affect mental ability.
The researchers do not know exactly how vitamin D and mental agility may be connected, but it could be connected to the vitamin's role in increasing certain hormonal activity, or it could have a protective effect on brain neurons.

  If I told you there was something you could do to cut your risk of cancer by 60 percent -- and it wouldn't cost you a dime -- would you do it?

Well there is, and it's called sun exposure.

This latest study, published in the Annals of Epidemiology, is yet another piece in what's turning into a mountain of evidence showing vitamin D's effectiveness for a wide variety of cancers.
The idea of getting sun exposure in order to stay healthy is such a simple strategy it's easily dismissed in this age where so many folks believe health comes in a pill and costs a fortune. But it's true, and with the mounting evidence, not even conventional medicine can ignore it any longer.
In fact, some of the top vitamin D experts in the world believe optimizing your vitamin D levels by getting proper sun exposure is the next largest variable after smoking that can influence whether or not you'll get cancer.
I am a bit surprised at that comment as from my understanding vitamin D has a far more profound impact on cancer. Vitamin D seems to universally lower risk for nearly all cancers where smoking is primarily restricted to lung cancer. And if you took vitamin D as a smoker you would still radically reduce your cancer risk.
Vitamin D – One POWERFUL Cancer Prevention Strategy!
The seemingly limitless benefits of vitamin D are easier to fathom when you understand that it is actually a steroid hormone that influences your entire body. Receptors that respond to vitamin D have been found in almost every type of human cell, from your bones to your brain.
Your organs can convert the vitamin D in your bloodstream into calcitriol, which is the hormonal or activated version of vitamin D. Your organs then use it to repair damage, including that from cancer cells.
Your body is clearly designed to spend time in the sun.
But modern living has reduced most people's sun exposure to the point that the vast majority of the earth's population is now vitamin D deficient. According to one landmark study, some 600,000 cases of breast and colorectal cancers could be prevented each year if vitamin D levels among populations worldwide were increased. And that's just counting the death toll for two types of cancer.
Earlier studies have shown that optimizing your vitamin D levels could help you to prevent at least 16 different types of cancer including pancreatic, lung, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancers. But now we're starting to see more evidence that the type of cancer in question may not be all that important, because vitamin D appears to play a key role in the development of ALL types of cancer!
One recent large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled study on vitamin D and cancer showed that vitamin D can cut overall cancer risk by as much as 60 percent! This was such groundbreaking news, the Canadian Cancer Society has actually begun endorsing the vitamin as a cancer-prevention therapy.
Similar results were shown in another study investigating vitamin D's impact on breast cancer. It discovered that light-skinned women who had high amounts of long-term sun exposure had half the risk of developing advanced breast cancer (cancer that spreads beyond your breast) as women with lower amounts of regular sun exposure.
But the benefits of vitamin D go far beyond cancer.
In fact, optimizing your vitamin D levels may lower your risk of dying from ANY cause, according to a recent European study.
Where You Live Impacts Your Cancer Risk
The connection between sun exposure and cancer is further solidified by studies showing that the farther away from the equator you live, the higher your risk of dying from cancer becomes.
In other words, those living in higher latitudes have higher cancer rates than those living in lower latitudes. And the difference is quite significant.

For example, people living in Iceland have cancer rates of 90 out of 100,000 per year. Those in the tropics, meanwhile, have rates of 25 per 100,000!

Additionally, the majority of cancer deaths in the U.S. are from vitamin-D-sensitive cancers.
How Does Vitamin D Prevent Cancer?
For a quick intro, watch this short 5-minute presentation by Dr. William Grant, who is an internationally recognized research scientist and vitamin D expert. (He is also the director of the Sunlight, Nutrition and Health Research Center, an entity devoted to research, education, and advocacy relating to the prevention of chronic disease through changes in diet and lifestyle.)
Dr. Grant recently uncovered exciting potential for the use of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of a number of high-incidence cancers found in Western populations.
According to his estimates, about 30 percent of cancer deaths -- which amounts to 2 million worldwide and 200,000 in the United States -- could be prevented each year with higher levels of vitamin D.

His conclusions are echoed by lead researcher Cedric Garland, DrPH, in the Science Daily article above, who stated,
""The first event in cancer is loss of communication among cells due to, among other things, low vitamin D and calcium levels.

In this new model, we propose that this loss may play a key role in cancer by disrupting the communication between cells that is essential to healthy cell turnover, allowing more aggressive cancer cells to take over.""
He too suggests that much of the cancer process could be arrested at the outset by maintaining adequate vitamin D levels.
""Vitamin D may halt the first stage of the cancer process by re-establishing intercellular junctions in malignancies having an intact vitamin D receptor,"" Dr. Garland said.
Living Not Only Longer and Healthier, but Also Saner, with Vitamin D
As I stated earlier, reduced cancer risk is not the only benefit of having optimal vitamin D levels. Getting more of the ""sunshine vitamin"" may also help you keep your smarts as you age.
Another new study published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry just last month, bolsters evidence that vitamin D helps older people stay mentally fit.
Their findings are some of the strongest evidence yet of the link between mental agility and vitamin D levels, due to the size of the study and because the researchers adjusted for a number of lifestyle factors believed to affect mental ability.
They still don't know exactly how vitamin D and mental agility may be connected, but suggest it could be connected to vitamin D's role in increasing certain hormonal activity, or it could have a protective effect on brain neurons.
Either way, other studies have also explored vitamin D's impact on brain function and found that it has a protective and normalizing effect, even on more serious brain disorders such as schizophrenia.
How do You Know You Have Sufficient Vitamin D?
Most people only get 250-300 units of vitamin D a day from their diet, so another source -- ideally the sun -- is essential.
But how much is enough?
In the article above, lead researcher Dr. Garland states that ""vitamin D levels can be increased by modest supplementation with vitamin D3 in the range of 2000 IU/day.""
This, however, is likely NOT enough for most people, especially for active cancer prevention in high-risk individuals.
But rather than focus on how much vitamin D you need, it's more important to get your levels checked regularly by a proficient lab, and supplement accordingly until you're within a healthy range. Or, for active cancer prevention, until you're in the clinically effective range.
For a more in-depth overview of optimal vitamin D ranges and testing, please see my previous article, which contains the latest information on this topic.
It's important to realize however, that your ideal source is from appropriate sunshine exposure. Your body can safely create as much as 20,000 units a day this way, without any risk of overdosing – a factor you'll have to contend with if you're taking oral supplements."

The Monsanto ads are, quite simply, false. The premise of the ad is that Monsanto’s GM seeds are going to save the world from environmental catastrophe and human hunger, but the reality of Monsanto’s seeds and the company’s ethics and commitment to fighting world hunger have little to do with either.
Eighty-five percent of all GM seeds are engineered for herbicide tolerance, most of these being Monsanto’s “Roundup Ready” cotton, corn, soy, and canola seeds. This allows plants to withstand significant amounts of pesticides being sprayed on it, in effect promoting pesticide use. As a result, there has been an increase in pesticide use in the United States since the introduction of GM seeds. Since the introduction of GM crops in the United States, more than 120 million pounds of additional pesticides were used.
At the same time, not a single GM crop has been commercially introduced that is intended to increase yield. Agronomists and plant scientists made far greater advances in yields through conventional breeding methods than they ever have with GM crops. In fact, there have been several studies which show that there are actually yield losses associated with Monsanto’s Roundup Ready soybeans. GM crops are not feeding the world, and they are not enabling us to produce more.
Monsanto wants you to believe their crops are feeding hungry children in Africa, and that they are allowing farmers to use fewer chemicals. But do their actions demonstrate that their concern lies solely in their profits?"

These stores are quickly discounted as being untrue or hypochondriac in nature. And yet, these stories and case studies continue to emerge As reported in one publication, ""In one pooled study that combined nine well-conducted studies from several countries, including a study from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a twofold excess risk of childhood leukemia was associated with exposure to magnetic fields above 0.4 µT. In another pooled study that combined 15 studies, a similar increased risk was seen above 0.3 µT.""i

In yet another study, ""A questionnaire survey of 2,072 people in California found that the prevalence of ES [electro¬sensitive] within the sample group was 3.24% with ES being defined as ""Being allergic or very sensitive to getting near electrical appliances, computers, or power lines"" (Levallois 2002, response rate 58.3%). A similar questionnaire survey from the same year in Stockholm County (Sweden), found a 15% prevalence of ES amongst the sample group, with ES being defined as ""Hypersensitivity or allergy to electric or magnetic fields"" (Hillert 2002, response rate 73%).""ii

In addition, there is now a plethora of products that are making claims of ""protection,"" ""shielding,"" or ""reduction"" of exposure to EMF. There is no magic pill or product that can protect us, and though it is true that some of the products are effective, none of them address all of the issues. And in fact, if misused, they can exacerbate the situation. 

The general public is often overwhelmed with the technical terms and the complexity, so the tendency has been to simply ignore the issue Though the majority of the general public believes there is some risk in using a cell phone, people continue to use it because it is convenient. Just as people know that ""fast food"" is not healthy, the convenience trumps the risk. What the general public does now know is that the largest risk to EMF may not be the cell phone (though it is bad there as well), but within their bedroom. At night our bodies recuperate from the daily onslaught of stress, our cells and organs detoxify and replace themselves. If this process is interrupted because our cell membranes are in constant stress, then healthy cells can be damaged iii, iv, while unhealthy cells (infections, mutations, neural disorders)v,vi can proliferate. For example, several individuals link Lyme disease to electromagnetic exposure as follows:
  ""Nodular, discoid morphoea-like, and widespread cutaneous fibroses in chronic Borrelia infection may be provoked by trauma, surgery or electromagnetic radiation.""vii
  ""Just as Lyme Disease sufferers using rife technology experience herx reactions following treatment sessions, it is feasible that people with EMF [electromagnetic fielci] sensitivity are experiencing the effects of electromagnetic fields on undiagnosed infections in their body ""viii 
""Based on the growing consensus that Lyme Disease is often misdiagnosed and is spreading rapidly, it seems possible that EMF [electromagnetic field] sensitivity may in fact be due to undiagnosed Lyme Disease or similar infection. According to one author, the problem of EMF sensitivity has grown to epidemic proportions. Further evidence supporting this hypothesis is that many people who suffer from EMF sensitivity have lots of other health problems that suggest infection.""ix
  Research has established that our bodies communicate first bio-electrically and then bio-chemicallyx. 

In nature there are many electromagnetic fields that have no adverse effect on our bodies, That is because natural fields are either temporally constant (same frequency) or spatially constant (same shape), but not both. On the other hand, manmade signals by necessity for communication are both temporally and spatially constant. According to Dr. Carlo, with prolonged exposure, these constant signals can cause the protein vibratory receptors located on our cell membranes to go into resonancexi

Once in resonance, the cell must determine whether the ""signal"" is a biological communication or a foreign invader. If the latter, as is the case with all man made signals, then the cell will react by going into sympathetic lock in order to protect the cell from this perceived invasion. Sympathetic lock prevents the cell from taking in nutrition and releasing toxins.

This cell membrane reaction triggers a cascade of events that can then manifest itself in a variety of symptoms and diseases starting with compromising the immune system. According to Dr. Becker, ""it is well-established that exposure to any abnormal electromagnetic field produces a stress response. If the exposure is prolonged, the stress-response system becomes exhausted, and the competency of the immune system declines to below normal. In such a state, animals and humans are more susceptible to cancer and infectious diseases.""xii

Note that though the discussion here is about healthy cells, other cells within our bodies, such as viruses and bacteria, will also respond as if under attack and proliferate in order to survive.

So how does one protect themselves and their family? The answer is by Creating Sleeping Sanctuaries Read on to find the steps to take to identify and remove as much of this ""electrosmog"" from their bedroom as possible. In a recent article in the Townsend Letter, the ""Guided Digital Medicine Management of Lyme Disease consists of four main components:"" of which ""Component #4 addresses blocks and potential blocks to the treatment: diet, reduction of electromagnetic pollution, emotional stress, etc.""xiii
Creating a Sleeping Sanctuary - Limiting the Electrosmog 
The ultimate goal is to expose the body to as natural a background as possible. Unfortunately, in most living environments this will require some type of protection as the external environment is also polluted. However, we find by far that the indoor pollution (that within your control) is quite often much higher than the external environment.
Step 1: Magnetic fields 
Magnetic therapy has been established as a well-known treatment, especially for those with inflammation; however, chronic exposure nightly can cause problems. Magnetic fields have a direct impact to the intercellular gap junction communication.xiv

Magnetic fields are caused whenever there is an unbalanced flow of current. They cannot easily be shielded and will penetrate through walls, floors and ceilings. Thus, the best advice is to first determine if you have them and then distance yourself from them.

Sources:
Digital clocks with displays (move at least 6ft from bed) 
Appliances (refrigerators, TVs, stereos, air conditioning units) - should not be within 6ft of sleeping area - this includes the adjacent room or room above or below) 
Breaker/Fuse boxes - should not be within 6ft of sleeping area - this includes an adjacent room 
Wiring errors - this requires you to investigate with a Gaussmeter. You can buy an inexpensive Gaussmeter and then survey your sleeping area. Levels above 1 mG are considered too highxv
Step 2: Electric fields 
Electric fields are present whenever there is something nearby that is energized or ""hot."" Electric fields have a beginning and an end, and therefore, there are ways to shield from these. Because of the orthogonal magnetic field component of electric fields, it is suspected that the biological interaction of electric fields also occurs at the intercellular gap junctionxvi One of the critical elements of exposure to electric fields is the reduction of melatonin.xvii

The biological effects of such have been attributed to neurological and malignant growth effects within the bodyxviii

Sources:
Wiring in the walls and wall outlets that are within 6ft of the bed - turn these off at night by flipping the circuit breaker, or install a demand switch that leaves them off unless needed 
Electrical appliances, such as lamps, extension cords, alarm clocks or radios - do not use these at night, if you need something near your bed, use a battery-powered device 
Step 3: Radio frequency fields 
This category includes everything that is used for wireless communications, from radios, to TV's, to cell phones, to wireless internets. Human bodies are not designed to live within a world with elevated radio frequency signals; yet we have created such an environment. Long-term exposure to low levels of RF can cause sympathetic lock of cell membranes and tile consequential cascade of cellular dysfunction.xix

Sources:
Turn OFF all wireless devices at night. If you need something at night, don't use devices that are wireless. 
Examples of wireless devices that are often found in bedrooms, that should not be present - cordless telephones, RF baby monitors, and wireless speakers. Of these, the cordless phone base appears to have the worst biological impact as many of them transmit a signal 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. 
Avoid any wireless device that is digital. There are baby monitors available that are not digital. 
Protection from external RF sources can best be done by erecting a canopy made from RF reflective material over the bed. Films and fabric on windows may also be effective, but quite often the signal is also penetrating through the walls, floors or ceilings. 
Step 4: Static Magnetic fields 
Metal bedsprings often have residual magnetism, either from when mined or due to repetitive compression over time Though magnetic therapy can be beneficial, constant exposure to magnetic field anomalies can reduce the production of red blood cells and disturb the REM sleep.xx And as with electric fields, static fields can also reduce melatoninxxi

Replace any bed where a liquid-filled compass slid slowly over the bed has a needle deflection 
Note that cribs with metal are especially susceptible to this

While not harmful in and of itself — your liver actually produces oxalate naturally1 — oxalates can cause problems when they over accumulate.
Over accumulation can occur either from overconsumption, or because your body either absorbs exceptionally high amounts of soluble oxalates or overproduces oxalate (primary hyperoxaluria2), or if you excrete excessive amounts of urinary calcium (hypercalciuria3).4
An over accumulation of oxalate in your kidneys can lead to the development of calcium oxalate kidney stones, the most common type of kidney stones.5 The stones form when your urine becomes highly concentrated, allowing the calcium and oxalate from your diet to crystallize.
If you are predisposed to kidney stones or have calcium oxalate stones already, your doctor may recommend avoiding foods rich in oxalates, such as dark green vegetables (especially spinach and Swiss chard), bran, rhubarb, beets and beet greens, chocolate, nuts (especially almonds, cashews and peanuts) and nut butters.6,7
Is Calcium and Oxalate in Combination Good or Bad?
In the past, kidney stone sufferers have also been warned to avoid foods rich in calcium. However, as noted in a 2004 paper in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, this strategy was never actually proven to reduce the risk.8
""By contrast, already in 1969, a Ca-restricted diet was shown to increase the gastrointestinal absorption of oxalate, leading to increased amounts of oxalate in the urine and an increased risk of the formation of Ca oxalate stones,"" the paper states.9
Today, experts have largely abandoned the recommendation to limit calcium, as we now know this may do more harm than good. A 1997 study10 in the Annals of Internal Medicine that looked at 12-years' worth of data from 91,731 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study concluded:
""The relative risk for stone formation in women in the highest quintile of dietary calcium intake compared with women in the lowest quintile was 0.65. The relative risk in women who took supplemental calcium compared with women who did not was 1.20.
In 67% of women who took supplemental calcium, the calcium either was not consumed with a meal or was consumed with meals whose oxalate content was probably low …
High intake of dietary calcium appears to decrease risk for symptomatic kidney stones, whereas intake of supplemental calcium may increase risk. Because dietary calcium reduces the absorption of oxalate, the apparently different effects caused by the type of calcium may be associated with the timing of calcium ingestion relative to the amount of oxalate consumed.""
Why Increased Calcium Intake Actually Lowers Your Risk of Kidney Stones
While increasing calcium in your diet may seem counterintuitive, seeing how calcium is the largest component of these stones, the answer to this paradox is that high dietary calcium actually blocks a chemical action that causes the formation of the stones in the first place. As explained by the Cleveland Clinic:11
""Low amounts of calcium in your diet will increase your chances of forming calcium oxalate kidney stones … [C]alcium binds oxalate in the intestines. A diet rich in calcium helps reduce the amount of oxalate being absorbed by your body, so stones are less likely to form.
Eat calcium rich foods and beverages every day (2 to 3 servings) from dairy foods or other calcium-rich foods. Also, eating high calcium foods at the same time as high oxalate food is helpful …""
World's Healthiest Foods further explains:12
""[O]xalate only gets absorbed from our digestive tract when it is in soluble form. Sodium oxalate and potassium oxalate are the predominant soluble forms. By contract [sic], calcium oxalate is insoluble, and magnesium oxalate is poorly soluble. So the form of the oxalate is important in the absorption process.
Second, our gut bacteria turn out to play a critical role in the amount of oxalate available for absorption since numerous species of gut bacteria are able to break down oxalate. These species include Oxalobacter formigenes, numerous species of Lactobacillus, and several species of Bifidobacteria …
Third, research has shown that the overall combination of foods that we eat during a meal (including both oxalate-containing and non-oxalate-containing foods) can significantly impact the amount of soluble oxalates available for absorption from our digestive tract.
We've seen a study on Indian cuisine, for example, in which multiple-ingredient dishes like spinach (palak) also containing Indian cottage cheese (paneer) lowered the amount of soluble oxalates available for absorption by about 15-20%. So, as you can see, the relationship between dietary intake of oxalates and oxalate absorption is complicated …""
Dairy Reduces Oxalate Uptake From Spinach
A 2003 study13 demonstrated the difference calcium makes in oxalate uptake. Spinach contains both soluble and insoluble oxalates. In this study, they used frozen commercially available spinach bought in New Zealand, which was found to contain 736.6 milligrams (mg) of soluble oxalate and 220.1 mg of insoluble oxalate per 100 grams, along with 90 mg of total calcium, 76.7% of which was bound to insoluble oxalate and hence not bioavailable. As explained by the authors:
""When frozen convenience food is grilled there is no opportunity for the soluble oxalates to be leached out into the cooking water and discarded. Soluble oxalates, when consumed, have the ability to bind to calcium in the spinach and any calcium in foods consumed with the spinach, reducing the absorption of soluble oxalate.""
Ten volunteers ate 100 grams of grilled spinach either alone, or with one of the following:
100 grams of cottage cheese
100 grams of sour cream
100 grams of sour cream with 180 grams of Calci-Trim milk14
20 grams of olive oil
Urine oxalate output was measured over a 6-hour and 24-hour period after eating. According to the authors, ""Addition of sour cream and Calci-Trim milk reduced the availability of the oxalate in the spinach significantly in both the 6-hour and 24-hour collection periods.""
Other Conditions Involving Oxalates
Painful kidney stones are not the only problem that can be caused by an accumulation of oxalate crystals. While your kidneys are the most commonly affected organ, oxalates can affect other organs and conditions as well. Examples include fibromyalgia and vulvodynia (vulvar pain).15
Oxalate stones can also be a source of inflammation and significant oxidative damage.16 Oxalate also impairs the absorption of nonheme iron and can lower your iron stores,17 needed for red blood cell formation.
What's more, oxalates have the ability to chelate a number of toxic metals, including mercury and lead. Unfortunately, they do this by trapping the heavy metals in your tissues, which makes it difficult to eliminate them.18
Oxalate Absorption Is Dependent on Daily Calcium Intake
Another study,19 published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2004, notes that ""2 to 20% of ingested oxalate is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy humans with a daily 800 mg calcium intake,"" and that ""Calcium is the most potent modifier of the oxalate absorption.""
I regularly consume two foods that are high in oxalate: our fermented beets that I use to increase my nitric oxide and sweet potatoes. I add one-half teaspoon of finely crushed egg shells to bind to the oxalates when I eat these foods.
In the 2004 study, to assess the exact correlation between calcium intake and oxalate absorption, healthy volunteers were given 0.37 millimole (mmol) of soluble salt sodium oxalate. Their calcium intake ranged from 200 mg to 1,800 mg.
""Within the range of 200 to 1200 mg calcium per day, oxalate absorption depended linearly on the calcium intake,"" the researchers state.20 ""With 200 mg calcium per day, the mean absorption was 17% … with 1200 mg calcium per day, the mean absorption was 2.6% …  
Within this range, reduction of the calcium supply by 70 mg increased the oxalate absorption by 1% and vice versa. Calcium addition beyond 1200 mg/d reduced the oxalate absorption only one-tenth as effectively.
With 1800 mg calcium per day, the mean absorption was 1.7% … The findings may explain why a low-calcium diet increases the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.""

When Eating Oxalate-Containing Food Take It With Your Calcium Supplement
As noted in the 1997 Annals of Internal Medicine study21 mentioned earlier, dietary calcium and calcium supplementation do not have identical effects. Whereas calcium-rich foods lowered the risk of kidney stones by 35%, calcium supplements raised it by 20%.
To reiterate, the reason for this discrepancy appears to be because most people either take their supplements on an empty stomach or with breakfast, which tends to be low or void of oxalates. Few actually eat veggies for breakfast.
That said, you can avoid this heightened risk by making sure you take your calcium supplement with lunch or dinner instead, which hopefully includes some leafy greens and other vegetables (i.e., oxalate-rich foods).
This will allow the calcium from your supplement to bind with the oxalate from the food in your intestine, and be safely eliminated through your stool rather than accumulate (and potentially crystallize) in your urine. Another alternative would be to take your supplement with a green smoothie or fresh-pressed vegetable juice in the morning.
While we're on the subject of calcium supplements, an inexpensive and all-natural alternative to calcium tablets is to grind clean, discarded, dried egg shells into a fine powder that you can then add to foods, smoothies and green juices.
According to one study,22 consuming just half an eggshell can supply you with the recommended reference daily intake of calcium (1,000 mg) for adults (age 19 to 50).23 You can read more about this technique, and its benefits, in ""Is Eating Eggshells Beneficial?""
Preventing Kidney Stones
To summarize, if you're taking a calcium supplement, take it with lunch or dinner to minimize your risk of kidney stones. If you don't take a calcium supplement, consider eating your veggies (and other high-oxalate foods) with a calcium-rich food. Examples mentioned included eating cooked spinach with some cottage cheese or sour cream. A glass of raw, organic milk or some organic raw butter could also do the trick.
All of that said, the No. 1 reason for kidney stone formation is dehydration, so staying well hydrated should be at the top of your list. If you aren't drinking enough water, your urine will have higher concentrations of substances that can precipitate out and form stones. As noted by the National Kidney Foundation:24
""Urine has various wastes dissolved in it. When there is too much waste in too little liquid, crystals begin to form. The crystals attract other elements and join together to form a solid that will get larger unless it is passed out of the body with the urine… In most people, having enough liquid washes them out or other chemicals in urine stop a stone from forming.""
The American College of Physicians' guidelines25 recommend drinking enough water to produce at least 2 liters of urine per day. Sugar (especially processed fructose), and hence processed foods are other contributing factors that are best avoided if you're concerned about kidney stones.26,27 Limiting animal protein and supplemental vitamin C is also recommended for those at risk of stone formation.28
Also be sure to get plenty of exercise to keep your body's fluids moving. Lastly, make sure you're getting adequate magnesium and vitamin B6 in your diet, as these nutrients may help prevent kidney stone formation.29
The combination of potassium citrate and magnesium citrate has also been shown to be ""an effective countermeasure for the increased risk of renal stone disease associated with immobilization,"" according to one study.30 Another found potassium/magnesium citrate ""effectively prevents recurrent calcium oxalate stones,"" and when taken for up to three years can reduce your risk of a recurrence by 85%.31"

The findings contradict the conventional wisdom that the sharp increase in diagnoses of wheat gluten intolerance has come about because of greater awareness and detection. It now seems likely that dramatic changes in the American diet have played a role.
The disease occurs in people whose bodies cannot digest gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. The undigested protein triggers the immune system to attack the lining of the small intestine, causing diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain.
The researchers who conducted the study also found that the recruits who had the undiagnosed digestive disorder, called celiac disease, had a four-fold increase in their risk of death."

But according to the study’s lead author Nicole Larson, the focus on the study was on calcium.
The words ""milk"" and ""calcium"" are often used interchangeably in the popular press. But while milk is a calcium source, no standard other than that of the National Dairy Council considers it the best calcium source.
The suggestion that you need to drink three glasses of the secretion of a cow's mammary glands in order to be healthy is a bit outrageous and doesn't fit the human evolutionary profile. In fact, most humans around the world cannot easily digest cow milk.
Yogurt has more calcium than milk and is easier to digest. Collards and other greens also have about as much or more calcium than milk by the cup. Greens, unlike milk, have the added benefit of vitamin K, also necessary for strong bones. Sesame is also very high in calcium.
When you measure calcium by cup of food product, milk is high on the list. When you view it by calorie, though, milk is at the bottom. A hundred calories of turnip greens have over three times as much calcium as 100 calories of whole milk."

His studies on the subject started in earnest when he read the book The Milk of Human Kindness Is Not Pasteurized, by maverick physician, William Campbell Douglass, MD.
Cowan became convinced that a large part of the disease in this country is related to the way we handle, or rather mishandle, milk and milk products.
Raw and cultured dairy products from healthy grass-fed cows are one of the healthiest foods people have ever eaten. However, pasteurized milk products have caused more disease than perhaps any other substance people are generally in contact with.
However, he still felt that a piece of the puzzle was missing. Many of his patients, in spite of eating only the proper dairy products, still had illness and still seemed not to tolerate milk. Recently, he was asked to consider writing the foreword to a book called The Devil in the Milk, written by Dr. Keith Woodford, which was again an eye-opener for him.
All proteins are long chains of amino acids. Beta casein is a chain 229 amino acids in length. Cows who produce this protein in their milk with a proline at number 67 are called A2 cows, and are the older breeds of cows (e.g. Jerseys, Asian and African cows). But some 5,000 years ago, a mutation occurred in this proline amino acid, converting it to histidine. Cows that have this mutated beta casein are called A1 cows, and include breeds like Holstein.
Proline has a strong bond to a small protein called BCM 7, which helps keep it from getting into the milk, so that essentially no BCM 7 is found in the urine, blood or GI tract of old-fashioned A2 cows. On the other hand, histidine, the mutated protein, only weakly holds on to BCM 7, so it is liberated in the GI tract of animals and humans who drink A1 cow milk.
BCM 7 has been shown to cause neurological impairment in animals and people exposed to it, especially autistic and schizophrenic changes. BCM 7 interferes with the immune response, and injecting BCM 7 in animal models has been shown to provoke type 1 diabetes. Dr. Woodford’s book presents research showing a direct correlation between a population’s exposure to A1 cow’s milk and incidence of autoimmune disease, heart disease, type 1 diabetes, autism, and schizophrenia.
Simply switching breeds of cows could result in amazing health benefits."

The popularity of agave syrup, also called agave nectar, is on a meteoric rise -- thanks in large part to clever marketing which positions the product as a healthy alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners.
Agave is also heavily promoted as a low glycemic food, enticing diabetics.
I’ll discuss just how “healthy” agave is in a minute.
The Amazing Power of Marketing
In case you doubt the influence of marketing in setting trends and consumer buying habits, look at these statistics:
Agave products more than tripled in number between 2003 and 2007.
McCormick & Co., a major food manufacturer, placed agave syrup in its “top 10 fla­vors” list for 2009.
Agave can now be found in prepared tea, energy and “health” drinks, nutrition bars, desserts, and other food items typically found in health food stores.
Agave is also quickly crossing over from the health food market to mainstream grocery chains, and consumers (especially vegans and raw food enthusiasts) are buying up bottles of the stuff to use in place of other sweeteners, like honey.
Why Agave Syrup is the Hottest New Trend in Sugar Alternatives
Taste. Agave has a subtle, delicate flavor many people enjoy.
Sweetness. Agave syrup can be up to three times as sweet as table sugar, so it takes less to sweeten a food or beverage.
Public perception. Highly effective agave product marketing campaigns have per­suaded consumers the sweetener is a healthy alternative to sugar. As more and more people veer away from deadly artificial sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup (but not from their sugar addiction, unfortunately), they are on the hunt for safer, healthier alter­natives.
About the Agave Plant
Agaves grow primarily in Mexico, but you can also find them in the southern and west­ern United States, as well as in South America. Previously, it was most commonly known  as a primary ingredient of tequila. Agaves are not cacti, but are actually related to the lily and amaryllis families of plants.
There are over 100 species of agave plants, in a wide variety of sizes and colors.
Edible parts of the agave are the flowers, leaves, stalks and the sap. It is the sap of the plant that is used to make agave syrup.
Commercially available agave syrup or nectar is thought to be produced primarily from blue agave plants grown in Southern Mexico. This is because the blue agave has a high carbohydrate content, which results in a high concentration of fructose in the final prod­uct.
Harvesting the Sap
When an agave plant is about seven to 10 years old, the leaves are removed to expose the core, or pina, of the plant. The harvested pina looks like a large pineapple and can weigh anywhere from 50 to 150 pounds.
Sap is removed from the pina, filtered, and heated to break down the carbohydrates into sugars.
The same agave plant produces all three varieties of commercially sold syrup, depend­ing on the amount of heat used in processing. These varieties include:

Many varieties of agave nectar are processed at relatively low temperatures (below 118°F) and are marketed as a “raw” food.
The Myth of Agave as a “Healthy” Sugar Substitute
Agave syrup is neither a natural food nor organic
Fully chemically processed sap from the agave plant is known as hydrolyzed high fructose inulin syrup.
According to Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health:
 “[Agave is] almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing.”
Agave syrup is not low calorie.
Agave syrup is about 16 calories per teaspoon, the same as table sugar.
Agave syrup may not have a low glycemic index.
Depending upon where the agave comes from and the amount of heat used to proc­ess it, your agave syrup can be anywhere from 55 percent to 90 percent fructose! (And it’s likely you won’t be able to tell from the product label.)
This range of fructose content hardly makes agave syrup a logical choice if you’re hoping to avoid the high levels of fructose in HFCS (high fructose corn syrup).
And if you’re diabetic, you should know that the alleged benefit of agave for diabetics is purely speculative. Very few agave studies have been docu­mented, and most involved rats. There have been no clinical studies done on its safety for diabetics.
Since most  agave syrup has such a high percentage of fructose, your blood sugar will likely spike just as it would if you were consuming regular sugar or HFCS, and you would also run the risk of raising your triglyceride levels. It’s also important to understand that whereas the glucose in other sugars are converted to blood glucose, fructose is a relatively unregulated source of fuel that your liver converts to fat and cholesterol.
A significant danger here is that fructose does not stimulate your insulin secretion, nor enhance leptin production, which is thought to be involved in appetite regulation. (This was detailed in one of the most thorough scientific analyses published to date on this topic.)
Because insulin and leptin act as key signals in regulating how much food you eat, as well as your body weight, dietary fructose can also contribute to increased food intake and weight gain.
Therefore, if you need to lose weight, fructose is one type of sugar you’ll definitely want to avoid, no matter what the source is.
Other Dangers of Fructose
In addition, consuming high amounts of concentrated fructose may cause health problems ranging from mineral depletion, to insulin resistance, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even miscarriage in pregnant women.
Fructose may also interfere with your body’s ability to metabolize copper. This can result in depletion of collagen and elastin, which are vital connective tissues. A copper deficiency can also result in anemia, fragile bones, defects in your arteries, infertility, high choles­terol and heart disease, and uncontrolled blood sugar levels.
Additionally, fructose consumption has been shown to significantly increase uric acid. Elevated lev­els of uric acid are markers for heart disease. It has also been shown to increase blood lactic acid, especially in diabetics. Elevations in lactic acid can result in metabolic acido­sis.
Isolated fructose has no enzymes, vitamins or minerals and can rob your body of these nutrients in order to assimilate itself. Hence, consumption of fructose can also lead to loss of vital minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc.
Other Reasons You Should Steer Clear of Agave
There are very few quality controls in place to monitor the production of agave syrup. Nearly all agave sold in the U.S. comes from Mexico. Industry insiders are concerned agave distributors are using lesser, even toxic, agave plants due to a shortage of blue agave.

There are also concerns that some distributors are cutting agave syrup with corn syrup -- how often and to what extent is anyone’s guess. In addition, the FDA has refused shipments of agave syrup due to excessive pesticide residues.
Agave syrup is not a whole food -- it is fractionated and processed. The sap is sepa­rated from the plant and treated with heat, similar to how maple sap is made into maple syrup. Agave nectar is devoid of many of the nutrients contained in the original, whole plant.
Agave syrup is not a live food. The natural enzymes are removed to prevent  agave syrup from fermenting and turning into tequila in your food pantry or cabi­net.
Agave is, for all intents and purposes, highly concentrated sugar. Sugar and sweet­eners wreak havoc on your health and are highly addictive.
The Case Against Sugar
No matter your nutritional type, sugar is not good for you. Certainly you can tolerate small amounts if you are healthy and the majority of your diet is healthy, but let’s face it the average American is consuming over 150 pounds a year of sugar or nearly half a pound a day.  Ideally your annual consumption should be well under ten pounds per YEAR.
Sugar increases your insulin and leptin levels and decreases receptor sensitivity of both these hormones. This can lead to a wide range of health problems, including weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, premature aging, and heart dis­ease.
Sugar suppresses your immune system, causing problems with allergies and digestive disorders. It can even bring on depression.
For a comprehensive list of the dangers of sugar to your body, read 76 ways sugar can destroy your health now.
Worse Than Any Sugar: Artificial Sweeteners
The worst of all possible choices are artificial sweeteners. They are, without question, far more damaging to your health than regular sugar.
While I don’t recommend it, consuming sugar in moderation isn’t likely to cause serious health problems. Moderation in this case is five pounds or less per year, which is a far cry from the 150 pounds per year consumed by the majority of Americans.
If you’re interested in kicking your sugar addiction, I highly recommend  trying a meridian tapping technique called Turbo Tapping, which has helped thousands of people kick their sugar and soda habits.
Have You Tried Stevia?
If you’re determined to sweeten your foods and beverages, I urge you to consider using stevia. Stevia is a sweet herb, safe and natural. It is much sweeter than sugar, but has no calories. It is my personal choice of sweetener.
In the U.S., you’ll find stevia not in the sweetener aisle of your local grocery, but in the supplement section. It can be used in appetizers, beverages, soups, salads, vegetables, desserts -- just about anything.
If you’ve tried stevia and were bothered by an aftertaste, it could be the way the plant was processed. You should try a few different brands until you find one that tastes good.
However, if you have insulin issues, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or if you’re overweight, I suggest you avoid all sweeteners, including stevia, since any sweetener can decrease your insulin sensitivity.
For everyone else, my recommendation is to:
Eliminate all artificial sweeteners
Avoid agave
Limit sugar
Use raw, organic honey in moderation
Use regular stevia in moderation, but avoid stevia-based sweeteners like Truvia and PureVia"

Many studies have shown that organically grown food has more minerals and nutrients than food grown with synthetic pesticides. And there’s a good reason why many chefs use organic foods in their recipes -- they taste better.
Save money
Growing your own food can help cut the cost of your grocery bill.
Protect future generations
The average child receives four times more exposure than an adult to at least eight widely used cancer-causing pesticides in food.
Prevent soil erosion
More than 3 billion tons of topsoil are eroded from the United States’ croplands each year. In conventional farming, the soil is used more as a medium for holding plants in a vertical position so they can be chemically fertilized. As a result, American farms are suffering from the worst soil erosion in history.
Protect water quality
Pesticides -- some cancer causing -- contaminate the groundwater in 38 states, polluting the primary source of drinking water for more than half the country’s population.
Save energy
Modern farming uses more petroleum than any other single industry, consuming 12 percent of the country’s total energy supply. More energy is now used to produce synthetic fertilizers than to till, cultivate and harvest all the crops in the United States.
Keep chemicals off your plate
The EPA considers 60 percent of all herbicides, 90 percent of all fungicides and 30 percent of all insecticides carcinogenic. Pesticides may cause an extra 4 million cancer cases among Americans.
Protect farm workers & help small farmers
Farmers exposed to herbicides have six times more risk than non-farmers of contracting cancer. And organic farming could be one of the few survival tactics left for family farms.
Promote biodiversity
Mono-cropping is the practice of planting large plots of land with the same crop year after year. The lack of natural diversity of plant life has left the soil lacking in natural minerals and nutrients, and single crops are also much more susceptible to pests, making farmers more reliant on pesticides.

The agency started a study last year on the role of vitamin D in severe seasonal influenza, which it said it will now adapt to the H1N1 swine flu virus.
Part of the researchers’ goal is to understand whether vitamin D levels are in any way responsible for the fact that most people with seasonal influenza develop a mild illness, but a small minority go on to develop severe symptoms.
According to PHAC, results from its study will indicate the extent and nature of the role of vitamin D in severe seasonal influenza.

Vitamin D Dose Recommendations
Age Dosage
Below 5 35 units per pound per day
Age 5 - 10 2500 units
Adults 5000 units
Pregnant Women 5000 units
WARNING: There is no way to know if the above recommendations are correct. The ONLY way to know is to test your blood. You might need 4-5 times the amount recommended above. Ideally your blood level of 25 OH D should be 60ng/ml.
  Canada appears to be one of the first countries to literally “see the light.”
Over the course of at least three flu seasons, Canada’s public health agency plans to analyze the impact vitamin D levels have on flu severity and, if they find a correlation between severe flu cases and vitamin D levels, will then decide whether vitamin D can be used to lessen serious cases of seasonal flu. While the study started out focused on seasonal flu, the agency is now adapting the study to the swine flu virus.
This is exactly the type of research that stands to make a real difference in public health, with the unfortunate aspect being that it may take years to bear out.
I highly suggest you don’t wait for their results to come in, as there is already overflowing evidence showing that your vitamin D levels play a role in your likelihood of getting the flu.
Vitamin D is a Powerful Flu Fighter
Dr. John Cannell, founder of the Vitamin D Council, first introduced the hypothesis that influenza is merely a symptom of vitamin D deficiency in the paper Epidemic Influenza and Vitamin D, published in the journal Epidemiology and Infection two years ago, followed up with another study published in the Virology Journal last year.
The findings were confirmed by a new study -- the largest and most nationally representative of its kind to date -- that involved about 19,000 Americans. It found that people with the lowest blood vitamin D levels reported having significantly more recent colds or cases of the flu.
In conclusion, lead author Dr. Adit Ginde stated:
""The findings of our study support an important role for vitamin D in prevention of common respiratory infections, such as colds and the flu. Individuals with common lung diseases, such as asthma or emphysema, may be particularly susceptible to respiratory infections from vitamin D deficiency.""
There is so much compelling evidence, that I believe optimizing your vitamin D levels is one of the absolute best strategies for avoiding infections of ALL kinds, and vitamin D deficiency is likely the TRUE culprit behind the seasonality of the flu -- not the flu virus itself.
How do You Know if Your Vitamin D Levels are Optimal or Deficient?
In the United States, the late winter average vitamin D level is only about 15-18 ng/ml, which is considered a very serious deficiency state. It’s estimated that over 95 percent of U.S. senior citizens may be deficient, along with 85 percent of the American public.
Unless you are getting daily sun exposure on a large portion of your body, it’s imperative to have your vitamin D levels checked on a regular basis. This is especially important if you’re taking a vitamin D supplement.
It’s important to realize, however, that what’s conventionally considered normal is NOT the same as optimal. I strongly believe you could avoid colds and influenza entirely by maintaining your vitamin D level in the optimal range, as noted in the chart that follows.
(Holick MF. Calcium and Vitamin D. Diagnostics and Therapeutics. Clin Lab Med. 2000 Sep;20(3):569-90)
The ideal way to increase your levels is by getting safe sun exposure. The next best option would be to use a safe tanning bed. The third route you can take is to use a vitamin D3 supplement, but because it’s possible to overdose from this type of vitamin D, you should be sure to have your levels tested regularly to remain in the therapeutic range.
For adults, the appropriate dose is likely 4,000-5,000 units per day, but it could be even higher. In fact, according to Dr. Heaney, your body requires 4,000 IU’s daily just to maintain its current vitamin D level. So in order to actually raise your levels, you’d have to increase either your exposure to sunshine, or supplement with oral vitamin D3 (which, again, I do not recommend without having your levels tested).
When you go in for your vitamin D blood test, if you’re in the United States be certain your test is performed at a lab like Labcorp, which uses the gold standard Diasorin test for checking vitamin D levels.
Also be sure you order the correct test. 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, is the better marker of overall D status. It is this marker that is most strongly associated with overall health.
You Can Use Vitamin D to Treat the Flu, Too
As I said earlier, if you were to maintain your vitamin D levels within the optimal range shown above, you would likely avoid being affected during the cold and flu season entirely.
That said, if you are coming down with flu-like symptoms and have not been on vitamin D you can take doses of 50,000 units a day for three days to treat the acute infection. Some researchers like Dr. Cannell believe the dose could even be as high as 1,000 units per pound of body weight for three days.
However, most of Dr. Cannell's work was with seasonal and not pandemic flu. If your body has never been exposed to the antigens there is chance that the vitamin D might not work.
Ultimately, your best bet is to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D around 60 ng/ml year-round. To find out even more important information about vitamin D, I strongly recommend you watch my one-hour free vitamin D lecture along with my video on vitamin D’s role in flu prevention."

  You can likely cut your risk of cancer by 60 percent -- and it won’t cost you adime. Would you like to know how?
By getting sun exposure.
This simple action is what allows your body to produce vitamin D, which is actuallynot a vitamin at all but rather a steroid hormone that influences your entire body.Receptors that respond to vitamin D have been found in almost every type of humancell, from your bones to your brain.
Theories linking vitamin D to certain cancers have been tested and confirmed inmore than 200 epidemiological studies, and understanding of its physiological basisstems from more than 2,500 laboratory studies, according to epidemiologist CedricGarland, DrPH, professor of family and preventive medicine at the UC San Diego Schoolof Medicine.[1]
Dr. Garland is widely regarded as the top epidemiologist on vitamin D and its relationto health. He led one of the latest studies on vitamin D for cancer prevention andhis results, which were published in the Annals of Epidemiology[2],were nothing short of astonishing. Garland wrote:
“It is projected that raising the minimum year-around serum 25(OH)D [vitamin D]level to 40-60 ng/ml would prevent approximately 58,000 new cases of breast cancerand 49,000 new cases of colorectal cancer each year, and three quarters of deathsfrom these diseases, in the US and Canada.”
Further, the study proposed a new model of cancer development -- dubbed DINOMIT-- that is centered on a loss of cancer cells' ability to stick together. The modelis a departure from the older model of cancer development, which centers on geneticmutations as the earliest driving forces behind cancer. According to Dr. Garland:
""The first event in cancer is loss of communication among cells due to, among otherthings, low vitamin D and calcium levels. In this new model, we propose that thisloss may play a key role in cancer by disrupting the communication between cellsthat is essential to healthy cell turnover, allowing more aggressive cancer cellsto take over.""
Vitamin D is a Powerful Cancer Prevention Strategy
Dr. Garland’s findings only lend further credence to the mountain of growing evidencethat optimal levels of vitamin D are essential for your health. Here are just afew highlights into some of the most noteworthy findings:
Some 600,000 cases of breast and colorectal cancers could be prevented each year if vitamin D levels among populations worldwide were increased, according to previous research by Dr. Garland and colleagues.[3] And that’s just counting the death toll for two types of cancer.
Optimizing your vitamin D levels could help you to prevent at least 16 different types of cancer including pancreatic, lung, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancers.[4]
A large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled study on vitamin D and cancer showed that vitamin D can cut overall cancer risk by as much as 60 percent![5] This was such groundbreaking news that the Canadian Cancer Society has actually begun endorsing the vitamin as a cancer-prevention therapy.
Light-skinned women who had high amounts of long-term sun exposure had half the risk of developing advanced breast cancer (cancer that spreads beyond your breast) as women with lower amounts of regular sun exposure, according to a study in the American Journal of Epidemiology.[6]
A study by Dr. William Grant, Ph.D., internationally recognized research scientist and vitamin D expert, found that about 30 percent of cancer deaths -- which amounts to 2 million worldwide and 200,000 in the United States -- could be prevented each year with higher levels of vitamin D.[7]
Now we’re starting to see more evidence that the type of cancer in question maynot be all that important, because vitamin D appears to play a key role in the development-- and prevention -- of ALL types of cancer!
Beyond cancer, researchers have pointed out that increasing levels of vitamin Dcould prevent diseases that claim nearly 1 million lives throughout the world eachyear![8]
Why Isn’t This Being Shouted From the Rooftops??
The evidence is overwhelming, and the solution is incredibly simple. One way todrastically reduce your risk of cancer and countless other chronic diseases is tooptimize your levels of vitamin D either by safe sun exposure, tanning in a safetanning bed or taking a high-quality supplement.
Yet, a great deal of people around the world have heard nothing of this great “discovery.”It’s even likely that your doctor is among them.
And on top of that, many, many people are deficient in vitamin D. It’s thought thatover 95 percent of U.S. senior citizens may be deficient, along with 85 percentof the American public.
Clearly, the word needs to get out but the mainstream media is slow to react. Plus,there’s no money to be made on selling vitamin D (it’s one of the most inexpensivesupplements around) and sun exposure is free! So don’t count on any major corporationsor drug companies to help get the message out (rather, count on them to try andsuppress this lifesaving information).
The longer this information goes largely unnoticed, the more people who will dieunnecessarily from potentially preventable cancers and other diseases.
Fortunately, GrassrootsHealth D*action is on a mission to get the word out and solvethe vitamin D deficiency epidemic … in just one year’s time.
The D*Action Project: How YOU Can Make a Difference
GrassrootsHealth has launched a worldwide public health campaign to solve the vitaminD deficiency epidemic in a year through a focus on testing and education with allindividuals spreading the word.
And you are all invited to join in this campaign!
With Dr. Garland at the helm, The D*Action Project will be monitoring, for fiveyears, the health outcomes of individuals who get their vitamin D levels to thelevels of 40-60 ng/ml. I would highly recommend that you optimize your levels tothe high end of this spectrum, as optimal vitamin D levels are 50-65 ng/ml, or 65-90ng/ml if you are treating cancer.
Says Carole Baggerly, director of GrassrootsHealth:
""We will be tracking the incidence of many diseases, from cancer to diabetes andmuscular function as well as pain levels to see what effect the higher vitamin Dlevels may have.
We expect to see a significant reduction in the incidence of breast cancer (andits recurrence), colon cancer, diabetes and myocardial infarction, compared withthe general population. With the expansion of the project by individuals, we couldsubstantially reduce this epidemic in a few years!”
So how can you get involved?
Join theD*action Project!
Simply complete a health questionnaire and test your vitamin D levels two timesper year during the 5-year program to help demonstrate the public health impactof this nutrient.
GrassrootsHealth is sponsoring the use of blood spot test kits (laboratory analysisdone by ZRT Labs) for a $40 fee to each individual. The tests are to be done twicea year by each individual along with the submission of some basic health data. Thefee includes:
A vitamin D blood spot test kit to be used at home (except in the state of New York)
The results sent directly to you
You will be asked to take a quick health survey and also to take action to adjustyour vitamin D levels to get into the desired ranges, ideally in consultation witha knowledgeable health care professional.
If you are a physician, medical institution or other health group, please also getinvolved by contacting Baggerly directly at: carole@grassrootshealth.org
What will be done with the information you provide in the health survey?
A five-year study will be done with the data accumulated to evaluate the resultsof the program in disease prevention and to help create a long-term plan for publichealth.
Regularly testing your vitamin D levels and monitoring them to stay within therapeuticranges is a step I urge all of you to do for your health. By joining the D*ActionProject, you can make a major contribution to the health of the United States andyour own health at the same time!
This project depends on a true ‘grassroots’ health movement. Together we can stopthe vitamin D deficiency epidemic in its tracks and improve the health of millionsof people.
With only 100 of you joining today, and getting two friends to join in two weeks(and those two friends getting two more), by week 42 there could be 400,000,000people who are vitamin D ‘replete’ (more than the United States population)!
To find out more about vitamin D, including what your levels should be and how tosafely get them there, please watch my one-hour, free vitamin D lecture.
Then, do your part to stop vitamin D deficiency, and improve your own health, byJoiningthe D*Action Project Now, and encouraging your friends and family to doso also!"

1. What’s your book about?
Premonitions -- knowing what’s about to happen.
2. What’s a premonition?
“Premonition” literally means “forewarning.” Premonitions are a heads-up about something just around the corner, something that is usually unpleasant. It may be a health crisis, a death in the family, or a national disaster.
But premonitions come in all flavors. Sometimes they provide information about positive, pleasant happenings that lie ahead -- a job promotion, where the last remaining parking place is, or, in some instances, the winning lottery numbers.
3. A favorite example of yours?
Amanda, a young mother in Washington State, was awakened one night by a horrible dream. She dreamed that the chandelier in the next room had fallen from the ceiling onto her sleeping infant’s crib and crushed the baby. In the dream she saw a clock in the baby’s room that read 4:35, and that wind and rain were hammering the windows. Extremely upset, she awakened her husband and told him her dream. He said it was silly and to go back to sleep. But the dream was so frightening that Amanda went into the baby’s room and brought it back to bed with her. Soon she was awakened by a loud crash in the baby’s room. She rushed in to see that the chandelier had fallen and crushed the crib -- and that the clock in the room read 4:35, and that wind and rain were howling outside. Her dream premonition was camera-like in detail, including the specific event, the precise time, and even a change in the weather.
4. Why are premonitions about unpleasant things? Why don’t we have premonitions about winning the lottery, the right stocks to pick, or when to bail out of the stock market?
Most researchers believe premonitions are trying to do us a favor. They are mainly about survival. If you know that something life-threatening is approaching, you have a chance to avoid it. This would increase your chance of staying alive and reproducing -- our evolutionary imperative. That’s probably why premonitions are often about threats to our existence, why they have become built into our biology, and why probably everyone has a premonition sense to some degree.
5. Why did you write this book?
I actually tried not to write it. I largely ignored this stuff for years, but this didn’t work very well. My own experiences of premonitions grabbed me and wouldn’t let go.
During my first year in medical practice as an internist, I had a dream premonition that shook me up and made me realize the world worked differently than I had been taught.
Briefly, I dreamed about a detailed event in the life of the young son of one of my physician colleagues. It turned out to be so accurate it scared me. There was no way I could have known about the event ahead of time.
Then patients of mine began telling me about their own premonitions.
Even my physician colleagues would occasionally open up and share their premonitions with me.
So I decided this was a well-kept secret in medicine that needed telling.
The time is right for this book because science has come onto the premonitions scene. There are now hundreds of experiments that confirm premonitions, which have been replicated by researchers all over the world.
So there’s a new story to tell. It’s no longer only about people’s experiences, but it’s also about science.
Many people still think this stuff is just mumbo-jumbo and that there’s no science to back it up. It’s the “everybody knows” argument -- “everybody knows” you can’t see the future, so proof of premonitions cannot possibly exist.
That’s wrong. We now know we can see the future, because that’s what careful scientific studies show.
6. If people can see the future, why don’t they get rich playing the stock market?
Some do.
Bill Gates says, ""Sometimes, you have to rely on intuition.” Oprah Winfrey says, ""My business skills have come from being guided by my inner self -- my intuition."" Donald Trump says in The America We Deserve, “I’ve built a multi-billion empire by using my intuition.”
George Soros, the billionaire investor, has all sorts of theories to back up his decisions. But according to his son, “At least half of this is bull ... [T]he reason he changes his position on the market or whatever is because his back starts killing him. He literally goes into a spasm, and it’s this early warning sign.”
Researchers have tested CEOs of successful corporations for their ability to see the future, such as predicting a string of numbers they will be shown later. The CEOs who are good at this are usually those who are also highly successful in running their corporations. In other words, their precognitive ability correlates with their corporate success. CEOs who did not have this ability tend to have mediocre success rates in their corporations. So business success and premonition ability seem to go hand in hand.
In one study, experimenters were able to predict in advance the most successful corporate balance sheets by how well the CEOs did on tests that measured their ability to predict the future, such as a string of numbers they’d be shown later.
This ability was not dependent on reason or logic or inference. You can’t “reason” and “analyze” what a randomly chosen string of numbers is going to be.
Interestingly, these CEOs were shy about owning their premonition sense. They didn’t call their abilities premonitions, but good “business sense.” The polite word for premonitions in business is “business intuition.” There’s a growth industry in teaching business intuition. Google “business intuition” and you’ll come up with nearly a half million hits.
7. Do premonitions work for people in business who are not CEOs?
Yes.
I discuss several experiments in which people used their premonitions to make large sums of money in the silver futures market. One of these experiments was featured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.
8. So what keeps people from getting rich?
The limiting factor seems to be greed. When the subjects focused on making modest sums of money, the experiments worked; when they got greedy and tried to break the bank, the experiments flopped.
This reminds us of what happened on Wall Street beginning in the fall of ’08. Nearly all the pundits say the primary underlying reason for the crash was unbridled greed.
9. You talk about “evidence” for premonitions. But isn’t the evidence just anecdotes and people’s stories?
This field used to be only about stories, but that’s changed. There’s now a science of premonitions. For the first time in history, we can now use “premonition” and “science” in the same sentence.
Take the “presentiment” experiments that have been pioneered by consciousness researcher Dean Radin. Briefly, a person sits in front of a computer, which will make a random selection from a large collection of images that are of two types -- calming or violent. Calming images may be a lovely scene from nature; violent images deal with death, carnage, grisly autopsies, and so on. The subject has some physiological function being measured, such as the electrical conductivity of the skin or the diameter of the pupil. The bodily function begins to change several seconds before the image is randomly selected by the computer and shown on the screen. Here’s the shocker: the physiological change occurs to a greater degree if the image to be shown is violent in nature. How is this possible? How does the body know which image is going to be shown in the future?
Dozens of these studies have been done by various researchers. They show that we have a built-in, unconscious ability to know the future. Somehow the body knows before our awareness kicks in.
There’s a charming quotation in the book The Secret Life of Bees that captures this. Fourteen-year-old Lilly says, “The body knows things a long time before the mind catches up to them.”
Another type of experiment is called “remote viewing,” in which people can consciously know highly detailed information up to a week before it happens. These studies were pioneered at Stanford Research Institute and have been replicated at Princeton University and elsewhere.
10. How can we know when to take a premonition seriously?
If the premonition involves images of death, it’s wise to take it seriously. You might not get a second chance.
If the premonition is accompanied by physical symptoms, it deserves sincere consideration. A friend of mine, an ob-gyn doctor, usually gets a peculiar sensation in his chest before his patients deliver their babies. The feeling is so reliable that the nurses ask him how his chest is feeling as a guide to when their patients are going to deliver.
If the premonition is health-related, pay attention. A patient of mine had a dream premonition of “three little white spots” on her left ovary. She feared this meant she had ovarian cancer. We checked it out. Her sonogram showed she was accurate; she indeed had three little “white spots” on her left ovary, but they were benign ovarian cysts, not cancerous. She did the right thing; she had a health-related premonition, and she checked it out.
If the premonition is extremely vivid -- if it seems “realer than real” -- take it seriously.
A cardiologist I know had a vivid dream that a patient of his had a stroke while he was doing a cardiac catheterization, which was scheduled for the next day. He wondered whether he should cancel the study, but he told himself that dreams mean nothing and pressed ahead. The next day, while actually doing the catheterization, his patient had a stroke in precisely the same pattern he dreamed. It shook him up and completely shifted his attitude about premonitions. Now he takes them seriously.
Also, if the premonition is repetitive, as if clamoring for attention, pay attention. In one case, a woman dreamed repeatedly for a year that a nurse was holding a light to her lower leg. She could not figure out the meaning until she developed osteomyelitis, a bone infection at the site a year later.
People can become very skilled in knowing when to take a premonition seriously. They develop a refined sense over time. Practice makes perfect.
11. What do your colleagues in medicine think about your book?
Nearly all of them are supportive.
I’ve discussed premonitions with hundreds of physicians in lectures at medical schools and hospitals all over the country. I was hesitant at first, thinking they’d all probably get up and walk out. The opposite happens. They open up and share their own stories.
Following a lecture at a Harvard-sponsored conference, one female internist told me, “I see numbers in my dreams -- the actual lab values of my patients’ tests -- before I even order them.”
As mentioned, George Soros, the billionaire investor, has all sorts of theories to back up his decisions. But according to his son, “At least half of this is bull ... [T]he reason he changes his position on the market or whatever is because his back starts killing him. He literally goes into a spasm, and it’s this early warning sign.”
This is like the presentiment experiments, in which the body knows something is going to happen and starts reacting before awareness kicks in. It’s a premonition in the form of physical symptoms.
Again, I’m reminded of fourteen-year-old Lilly in The Secret Life of Bees: “The body knows things a long time before the mind catches up to them.”
Nurses have been very supportive of my ideas. They are more open to premonitions than just about anyone. They spend more time at the bedside than doctors do. Over the years, nurses often become very precognitive. Many of them say they “just know” when a stable patient is going to have trouble, such as a cardiac arrest.
Beth Wechsler, a social worker, reported a dream premonition in American Nurse Today (March 2009) that makes the point. In her dream, a young pediatric nurse answered the phone at the nurses’ station and was told to go to the lobby where a gravely ill patient was being admitted. She went down to find a little boy in blue, pink, and white pajamas. When she looked at the boy, she realized she had cared for him, and she knew he would die from cancer the next day. The boy came gratefully into her arms. At the hospital, she told her supervisor about her dream. Then the phone rang, and her dream began to unfold. The child was in the hospital lobby, dressed in the blue, pink, and white pajamas. He came into her arms, and by the next day, he was dead.
12. The subtitle of your book is “how knowing the future can shape our lives.” How can it?
Knowing the future can help you have a future.
Premonitions are often about survival. They warn us of future dangers -- health problems, impending accidents, disasters, and so on.
For example, research shows that people often avoid riding on trains the day they crash, compared to normal days. On days of the crash, the vacancy rate on the train is unusually high.
This type of premonition is usually unconscious. People don’t say, “The train is going to crash. I’m cancelling my reservation.” They usually report a vague sense that something is wrong or doesn’t feel right, and they find some reason to change their plans.
People may avoid doomed planes as well. The vacancy rate on the four planes that crashed on 9-11 was around 80 percent. This suggests that lots of people found some reason not to travel on those planes that day. (We don’t know for certain what this means, however, because the airlines won’t release vacancy rates for travel on the same flights for the preceding months, so there’s no way to know for sure how unusual these high vacancy rates actually were.)
But perhaps the main way premonitions affect our lives is by giving us a different way of thinking about our own consciousness, our own mind.
I discuss experiments in which conscious can operate both into the future and into the past. This suggests that time does not limit what our consciousness can do.
This raises the possibility that our consciousness is timeless. This opens up the possibility of immortality and the survival of some aspect of our consciousness following death.
13. Can we learn to have premonitions? Can we cultivate them?
Yes.
The main thing is not to try too hard. Premonitions usually come unbidden. They largely “do” us; we don’t “do” them.
So the trick is to invite them, not compel them, into your life.
First, simply realize that these experiences are extremely common, and that it’s likely that you will experience them.
Second, keep a dream journal, because premonitions occur most frequently during dreams. Record your dreams as soon as possible on waking. Most people find that premonitions become more frequent when they do this.
Third, learn to quiet your body and mind. Sit down, shut up, be quiet, and pay attention. Some people call this meditation; others simply call it “getting quiet.” Research shows that skilled meditators perform better on premonition experiments than just about anyone. Meditation opens a door to premonitions and helps us notice them when they occur.
Fourth, read about premonitions. What are they like for other people? This will help you recognize your own premonitions, and when to take them seriously.
Another reason to read about premonitions is that this can strengthen your believe in them, and, studies show, the stronger one’s belief in premonitions, the more likely valid premonitions are to occur. (This may be one reason skeptics say they don’t experience premonitions.)
14. You say that most premonitions are unconscious?
Yes.
Most premonitions occur in dreams. Dreams by definition are unconscious.
And many experiments show that people’s bodies react to future events even before they happen, without their being aware of it.
15. But if premonitions are largely unconscious, how can we make use of them?
Premonitions don’t have to be a detailed snapshot of the future, of which we’re fully aware, to be helpful. They can be just a hunch or a gut feeling that we act on without consciously knowing why.
Some researchers believe unconscious premonitions are the most valuable kind. If we unconsciously know something is going to happen, we can react without processing this information by thinking about it. Thinking takes time. In dangerous situations we need to act quickly, immediately, without wasting time through reason and intellectual analysis.
As a battalion surgeon in Vietnam, I knew many soldiers who swore they had some sixth sense that kept them alive by alerting them to danger. They’d react instantly without thinking, as if “on automatic.” I suggest they were using premonitions.
I discuss an event in which an entire group of church members were late for choir practice one weekday night at a little church in Beatrice, Nebraska. The church exploded, and would almost certainly have killed them had they been there. The odd thing is that none of them had any conscious premonition that the explosion would occur, but they stayed away nonetheless. Being late was an unconscious behavior, and it saved their life.
This sort of behavior is very common among mothers. They often have “just a feeling” their baby is headed for trouble, and they act on this impression without knowing why. The term “mother wit,” once very common, captured this idea.
16. Is there a downside to premonitions?
Yes.
Anything can be taken to extremes.
I’ve known a few individuals who won’t make major decisions without consulting a psychic. They become slaves to somebody else’s premonitions about the future.
Premonitions can be false. The mind plays tricks -- sometimes dirty tricks. Hallucinations happen. Just like we can have false memories of the past, we can have false impressions of the future.
17. So how can we avoid being misled by premonitions?
It’s pretty simple.
Premonitions are a single way of knowing the future, not the only way.
Whenever possible -- in non-emergencies -- we should rely on multiple sources of information —--logic, reason, and analysis, plus intuition, hunches, and premonitions.
Multiple strands of information help guard against bad decisions. When we rely on only one source of knowing, we can get into trouble.
This is common sense: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
18. Skeptics say we can’t know the future. When we appear to do so, it’ s just a chance happening. What about this?
The skeptics have a point.
No doubt some premonitions that seem to come true are nothing more than chance happenings or lucky hits.
But to say that all the billions of people throughout human history who have experienced premonitions that turned out to be valid are deluded seems highly unlikely.
Skeptics often single out examples of premonitions that are silly or nutty, then generalize to condemn all premonitions. This is irrational.
Or they say that people have selective memories. They only remember the premonitions that come true, and forget those that don’t. This is simply not true; people often recall premonitions that don’t pan out.
But even if valid premonitions are statistically unlikely, as the skeptics claim, that doesn’t necessarily mean they are false. Many things that are rare are nonetheless real. It is extremely unlikely that any particular individual can run a four-minute mile. But a few people can. It’s unfair to use statistics to dismiss rare events.
But the premise of my book is that these events are not rare at all, but very common.
Most skeptics are poorly informed. They simply ignore the experiments showing that people can sense the future, because these studies create huge holes in their arguments.
There are several categories of experiments that have put premonitions to the test -- hundreds of so-called precognitive remote viewing studies, presentiment studies, and on-line premonition tests, to name a few. The odds against a chance explanation for the positive results of all these studies are billions to one.
For many skeptics, these experiments don’t matter. They will not be persuaded that premonitions are real, no matter how compelling the evidence is. As one famous skeptic said, “This is the sort of thing I would not believe, even if it were true.”
Personal experience is probably the best argument against the skeptics of premonitions.
I give several examples in which a skeptical spouse profoundly disagreed about whether or not his or her partner’s premonition should be taken seriously. But when the premonition came true, the skeptical spouse came around to a different way of thinking. An example is Amanda’s precognitive dream that a falling chandelier would crush their baby in its crib. The husband dismissed it as silly. But when she removed the baby from the crib and the chandelier actually fell and demolished the crib, precisely as she had dreamed, her doubting husband changed his tune.
Cases like this suggest that the best evidence for premonitions is not argument or even experimental evidence, but personal experience.
19. You’ve written that one’s personality and temperament influence whether one is premonition-prone or not. But we can’t change our personalities, can we? And what personality traits favor premonitions?
A well-known personality test, the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI), has been used to identity individuals who are premonition prone. People who rank high on “extroversion” and “intuition” are likely to experience premonitions.
True, our personalities tend to be fairly stable, but they are not entirely fixed. Some days we may feel introverted, and some days we may feel so extroverted we can take on the world. Personalities aren’t written in stone.
Nobody should feel shut off from premonitions just because they have some particular personality pattern, because every known personality type experiences premonitions.
Here are some personality traits that make people premonition prone:
Absorption. This is the ability to focus on something, employing one’s fantasy and imagination.
A sense of oneness and unity with all life. If we feel connected with others, this makes it more likely that we’ll pick up on what’s going to happen to them in the future.
Belief in the transcendent. This involves a belief in larger patterns that connect everything, including the belief in a greater wisdom than our own, from which premonitions might arise.
Compassion and empathy. If we feel empathic and compassionate toward others, we are more likely to tune in on what may await them.
Intuition. This is the capacity to know things instinctively, including knowing the future. This is the socially acceptable term for premonitions.
Comfort with chaos and disorder. This involves “going with the flow,” not attempting to micro-manage what life brings, including being open to information that may arrive from the future.
External locus of control. An internal locus of control is typical of people who value “rugged individuality” and the sense that they control their own fate. “Externals” or “extrinsics,” in contrast, don’t attempt always to control or shape their own life events. They tend to view unexpected happenings as opportunities. They are more likely to have a trusting attitude toward the world, and to believe it has a benevolent side.
Meaning. Premonition-prone individuals tend to find meaning in life events, some purpose or direction to things, instead of viewing them as due to pure chance.
Positivity. Those who experience premonitions tend toward trust and optimism, and are more likely to “see the glass as half full” rather than half empty.
Respect for the unconscious. This involves trusting in messages from dreams and reverie, from which premonitions often arise. It may also involve cultivating activities that allow unconscious mental content to surface, such as during hiking, painting, needlework, gardening, etc.
Common sense. Those who have frequent premonitions usually have perfected ways of noticing and recalling them, such as writing down dreams on awakening.
20. Your book sounds a lot like the bestselling book Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell. He says we can know something is going to happen and make accurate snap decisions without knowing why.
You’re right. I love the examples Gladwell uses. Many of them are what I’m calling premonitions -- firemen who leave a burning room before the floor collapses, without knowing why they are doing so; George Soros’s predicting world markets without rationally knowing why; Vic Braden, the famous tennis coach, who can predict double faults with extreme accuracy without a clue about how he does it.
Gladwell regards this kind of knowing as a big fat mystery. He says we should “accept the mysterious nature of our snap judgments ... [W]e’re better off that way”.
I don’t think we’re better off that way. Gladwell literally endorses ignorance, which I find baffling. He completely ignores research such as the presentiment experiments. The term “premonition” does not even appear in his book. There is a great deal of evidence -- an entire chapter in my book -- that can shed light on what Gladwell dismisses as a total mystery. Why he won’t go there is unclear to me. Like many other science journalists, he’s reluctant to acknowledge that consciousness can operate outside the present and beyond the body. Although I agree with Gladwell that there’s mystery in all this, it’s not as dense as he says. We know a lot about premonitions -- their characteristics, what favors them, and what purposes they serve.
Some outstanding scientists are willing to consider premonitions as an explanation for the kind of knowing that Gladwell describes. Among them is Lord Paul Drayson, Britain’s science minister. In discussing Gladwell’s book Blink, Drayson says he has personally known in advance that something is going to happen. He says, “In my life there have been some things that I’ve known and I don’t know why ... like a sixth sense.” “Sixth sense” is a common term for premonitions.
James Carpenter, a psychologist and consciousness researcher, thinks “sixth sense” is misleading. He believes precognition is so fundamental and innate he calls it “first sense.” Carpenter says we always exist “a little beyond ourselves in space” and “a little ahead of ourselves in time.” If the need arises, we can exist beyond and ahead of ourselves not just a little, but a lot. I like this idea. “First sense” is like psychic radar that sweeps ahead of ourselves in space and time, informing us of events we need to know about. It operates unconsciously most of the time, for reasons I’ve mentioned, mainly having to do with efficiency.
21. OK, so there’s evidence that premonitions are real. It’s still mind-boggling. How could these things possibly happen?
I agree that premonitions seem impossible -- but only if we hold onto our common-sense beliefs about how the world works.
Many people believe that our minds are confined to the present and to the brain and body. To make a place for premonitions, we have to go beyond these core beliefs.
True, it seems as if we’re locked into our individual brains and bodies and the present, but the evidence from hundreds of experiments shows that this is an illusion.
Scientists don’t really know what time is. We assume it flows in one direction, which prohibits premonitions. But no experiment in the history of science has ever shown that time flows in one direction, or that it flows at all. Alternative views of time are downright cordial to premonitions.
For example, physicists talk about “closed time-like loops” that can carry information from the future into the present. This is one way premonitions might work.
Others suggest that the future is already present, already laid out, in what is called a “block universe.” During premonitions, we might gain access to this already-present information.
Other researchers suggest that the mind is nonlocal, which is a fancy word for infinite. According to this idea, consciousness is present everywhere in space and time. This means that we have access to all the information that has ever existed or will exist -- past, present, and future. This opens the door for premonitions.
These are all hypotheses, of course.
The main point is that our common-sense ideas about time, space, matter, and our own minds are flawed. The universe works differently than we supposed.
In view of our ignorance, we need to stay open to the evidence for premonitions and not fall back into our prejudices, as when skeptics say, “Everybody knows premonitions are impossible.”
Often in science and medicine we know that something happens before we understand how it happens. Explanations sometimes come much later. So it may be with premonitions.
22. If I can see the future, doesn’t that mean it is already in place and is fixed? Don’t premonitions do away with free will and freedom of choice?
No.
Just because you glimpse how the future is likely to unfold does not mean you can’t act to change it. When Amanda (see question 3 above) dreamed that the chandelier fell and crushed her sleeping infant, she removed the baby from the crib. The chandelier did fall, but the baby’s life was saved. She exercised her freedom of choice, and it made a life-and-death difference. There are thousands of similar examples.
Philosophers often argue against premonitions because they say premonitions destroy freedom of choice. But people who have premonitions usually don’t see it that way. Like Amanda, their personal experiences with premonitions say they do have a choice. They can act, and they do, to change the future they’ve glimpsed.
I agree with the idea that the future is probable, not fixed. According to this view, the future is fluid and subject to change. So a premonition is not inevitable.
Probability varies, of course. This means that some futures may be easier to change than others. It was easier for Amanda to act on her premonition and remove her baby from danger than for an individual to prevent an earthquake she dreamed about. Some futures may be so probable they will happen; others, perhaps most, are malleable.
23. What’s the Big Lesson from premonitions?
Premonitions are an incredible gift.
Although they are an aid to our physical survival, their main contribution is in providing us with an expanded vision of who we are and what our destiny may be. They show that we’re more than a physical brain and body. Brains can’t operate outside the present or beyond the body. But our consciousness can, as premonitions show.
Premonitions reveal that we’re not slaves to the body or to the present. We can operate outside of time; something about us is timeless.
The implications are quite wonderful, because they imply immortality.
Not a small contribution."

It goes without saying that your aim should be to avoid getting to the point where an implant is necessary, but if the damage is already done, or if you have an acute oral trauma, you now at least have some information that can help you make safer, healthier choices.
The impact your oral health has on the rest of your body is often overlooked, but that does not make it any less important. Likewise, any work you have done to your teeth can have a serious impact on your health, which I'll go over shortly.
Having a healthy set of teeth is a powerful predictor of your overall health. In my experience, sick patients who display near cavity-free teeth tend to get well fairly quickly. If, on the other hand, their mouths are full of fillings and root canals, the prognosis is not nearly as good.
The Link Between Oral Health and Disease
In the 1900s, Dr. Weston A. Price did extensive research on the link between oral health and physical diseases. He was one of the major nutritional pioneers of all time, and his research is just as relevant today as it was back then.
He discovered that native tribes that still ate their traditional diet had nearly perfect teeth and were almost 100 percent free of tooth decay. Certain diseases were also nearly unheard of, such as chronic diseases of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, joints, and skin – the types of diseases currently plaguing our society.
Once these tribal populations were introduced to sugar and white flour, their health, and their perfect teeth, rapidly deteriorated.
His classic book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration details his fascinating findings and is well worth reading.
There's no doubt that our modern diet has changed the inherent health of our teeth and our bodies, and is the cause of nearly all our modern health challenges.
Today it's quite rare to find an adult with teeth that has not been marred by dental work of some kind, from mercury amalgams (silver fillings) to crowns, to root canals and bridges and implants.
If you eat properly and maintain optimal health, you're highly unlikely to develop cavities. They really only occur when you're eating the wrong foods, and growing up, I did not eat the right foods. As a result, I, as so many others, had a mouth full of mercury fillings.
To learn more about this, take a look at this video on what mercury fillings do to your mouth.
I eventually had them replaced with gold fillings, only to later realize that gold fillings and crowns cause problems too. So after I'd already made an investment of several thousand dollars, I decided to replace them all again. This time with non-metal crowns, for the most part.
Conventional Versus Biological Dentistry
Unfortunately, conventional dentistry has generally only evaluated materials to be used for their mechanical characteristics, in large part ignoring the impact that particular material might have on the rest of your body.
Case in point: silver fillings, which are 50 percent mercury, an extremely potent neurotoxin, have been used for over 150 years. Likewise, the fact that various metals have been used for years to fashion tooth implants is by no means an indication of safety.
We are currently fighting to have mercury fillings banned completely in the U.S., as it has been in some other European countries, and hope to be able to get this toxic material off the market in the near future. Until then, it's up to you to refuse them, or find a dentist who has switched to safer alternatives.
My own struggles with my teeth led me to learn about it in the mid 1990s and embrace biological dentistry, also known as holistic or environmental dentistry.
In a nutshell, biological dentistry views your teeth and gums as an integrated part of your entire body, and any medical treatments performed takes this fact into account. The primary aim of this type of holistic dentistry is to resolve your dental problems while impacting the rest of your body as little as possible.
Unknowingly, your health can be significantly impacted by the treatments received at your conventional dentist's office. Oftentimes, the impact is just not immediately noticeable.
Implants Can Exacerbate Autoimmune Diseases
Currently, implants continue to be done without biocompatibility testing, and they are often used in extraction sites where cavitations (inflammation) are already developing.
Autoimmune diseases seem to be often aggravated or even initiated by metal implants.
Additionally, an event called oral galvanism occurs when you place two dissimilar metals in your mouth. You essentially create a battery that will serve to drive the ions of the metals out of the metal into your mouth and also generate electricity.
You may not realize it, but tiny electrical currents are foundational to the way your body operates biologically, and when you introduce a foreign source of electricity, especially one that is constantly there, you can introduce imbalances that can contribute to health problems.
This galvanic toxicity created when the metal in your mouth reacts with your saliva can over-stimulate your brain. This is true whether the metal in your mouth is a silver filling, a metal crown, or a metal dental implant.
Common signs and symptoms of galvanic toxicity include:
A metal taste in your mouth
A sensation of an electric charge when using metal utensils
Chronic insomnia
Finding suitable materials to replace the metals currently used is proving to be a challenge. However, you may now have access to a far better option if you need to have an entire tooth replaced.
Hopefully, by implementing the strategies below, it will never get to that point.
Health Implications of Cavities and Root Canals
Dental caries (cavities) is a reflection of systemic illness in your body. And, if you let it go long enough to where the cavity gets into the nerve and blood vessels, bacteria can hide in the tiny tubules of the dentin, causing chronic inflammation and infection that is near impossible to eradicate. So, never ignore signs like a toothache or a cavity.
Also, remember that they are major clues that your body is not optimally healthy and lifestyle changes are in order if you want to stop or reverse the damage that is already taking place.
As for root canals, nearly all contain colonies of bacteria that can cause major illnesses in your body. Even antibiotics won't help in these cases, because the bacteria are protected inside of your dead tooth. And when these bacteria migrate, via your bloodstream to other areas of your body, they can contribute to or cause more serious ailments such as:
Heart and circulatory diseases
Arthritis and rheumatism
Brain and nervous system diseases
Attending to your dental health is just as important as eating right and exercising for physical health. The two are connected, not separate systems, and each affects the other.
Do You Know What Makes for Healthy Teeth?
Although many would like to believe that regular brushing and flossing is all that's needed for healthy teeth, it's by no means the most important factor determining your oral health. Others insist that fluoride is the key. Don't believe it! The most important aspect is actually your diet, sans fluoridated water.

Hygiene practices are simply preventive aids that help minimize the destructive effect of a modern, refined diet, and fluoride causes far more health problems than it's believed to fix.
Another alternative to conventional dental fillings worth mentioning is tooth regeneration. The materials used for this procedure include solutions of chemicals that can actually rebuild decayed teeth. Enamel and dentin, the natural materials that make teeth the strongest pieces of your body, may someday replace conventional fillings.

Although this would certainly be a step up from using toxic substances like mercury to fill your teeth, it's still a type of band aid.
If you want to have healthy teeth, and a similarly healthy body, you must start from the inside out, and that means cleaning up your diet.
Healthy Diet, Healthy Teeth
When Dr. Price studied native diets, he noticed certain similarities in the foods that were keeping them so healthy. Among them:
The foods were natural, unprocessed, and organic (and contained no sugar except for the occasional bit of honey or maple syrup).
The people ate foods that grew in their native environment. In other words, they ate locally grown, seasonal foods.
Many of the cultures ate unpasteurized dairy products, and all of them ate fermented foods.
The people ate a significant portion of their food raw.
All of the cultures ate animal products, including animal fat and, often, full-fat butter and organ meats.
When Dr. Price analyzed his findings, he found that the native diets contained 10 times the amount of fat-soluble vitamins, and at least four times the amount of calcium, other minerals, and water-soluble vitamins, as that of Western diets at that time. Their diets were also rich in enzymes because they ate fermented and raw foods (enzymes help you to digest cooked foods).

The native diets also had at least 10 times more omega-3 fat than modern diets and FAR less omega-6 fats. And as some of you may know, a diet that is lacking in omega-3 fats, and heavy on omega-6 fats from vegetable oils (which are consumed so heavily today), is a recipe for disaster.

So, if you want to eat your way to healthy teeth, taking a lesson from these previous native generations is essential. You should:
Find out your nutritional type, and eat accordingly. This will tell you which foods are ideal for your unique biochemistry.
Eat at least one-third of your food raw.
Avoid processed foods, sugar, refined flour and all artificial flavorings, colorings, and artificial sweeteners. Instead, seek out locally grown foods that are in-season.
Enjoy fermented foods like natto, kefir and cultured veggies.
Make sure you eat enough healthy fats, including those from animal sources like omega-3 fat, and reduce your intake of omega-6 from vegetable oils.
All of the brushing and flossing in the world will not give you the healthy teeth that the above steps will, so if you value your pearly whites, get started eating a healthier diet today.
Find a Good Biological Dentist
Everyone needs a good dental consultant and, unfortunately, they are hard to find. There is no shortage of competent skilled caring dentists, but there is of ones who believe in the principles I outlined above.
There are several strategies you can use to locate one. Ideally you would ask a friend, relative, or neighbor who knows of one. If that fails you can contact several good natural health food stores in your area and ask a number of the employees or even the owner. Once you obtain the same name a number of times, that is typically a good sign.
Additionally there are organizations like D.A.M.S and International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology that have referral setups."

The damage may occur even when tests for a protein thought to signal injury are normal, and may persist even after statin use is halted.
About 10 to 15 percent of people taking statins report myalgia, or minor muscle aches and weakness. A smaller number have stronger, persistent pain, called myopathy. In a study, researchers biopsied leg muscle tissue from 83 patients: 44 were taking statins and had serious and persistent muscle pain, 19 were taking statins and had no myopathy, and 20 had never taken statins or suffered myopathy.

Squalene Update as of October 2009:
According to Barbara Loe Fisher, founder of the NVIC, none of the H1N1 vaccines being distributed in the United States contain squalene or other oil in water adjuvants.
We successfully made enough fuss about the potential danger of fast tracking licensure of squalene adjuvants into US H1N1 vaccines under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that can be invoked during a declared public health emergency that the FDA has NOT licensed these adjuvants for the U.S.
There is squalene in H1N1 vaccines licensed in Europe but not yet in the U.S. That is not to say the vaccine manufacturers will not try to get the adjuvants inserted into vaccines in the future, but for now we have won on this point.
According to Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, your children should be the first target for mass swine flu vaccinations when school starts this fall.[i]
This is a ridiculous assumption for many reasons, not to mention extremely high risk.
In Australia, where the winter season has begun, Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon is reassuring parents the swine flu is no more dangerous than regular seasonal flu. ""Most people, including children, will experience very mild symptoms and recover without any medical intervention,"" she said.[ii]
Sydney-based immunization specialist Robert Booy predicts swine flu might be fatal to about twice as many children in the coming year as regular influenza. Booy estimates 10-12 children could die from the H1N1 virus, compared with the five or six regular flu deaths seen among children in an average year in Australia.[iii]
""Cure the Disease, Kill the Patient""
Less than 100 children in the U.S. die each year from seasonal flu viruses.[iv] If we use Australia's math, a very rough estimate would be another 100 children could potentially die of swine flu in the United States in the coming year.
If children are the first target group in the U.S. per Sebelius, that means we're about to inject around 75 million children with a fast tracked vaccine containing novel adjuvants, including dangerous squalene, to prevent perhaps 100 deaths.
I'm not overlooking the tragedy of the loss of even one child to an illness like the H1N1 flu virus. But there can be no argument that unnecessary mass injection of millions of children with a vaccine containing an adjuvant known to cause a host of debilitating autoimmune diseases is a reckless, dangerous plan.
Why are Vaccinations Dangerous?
The presumed intent of a vaccination is to help you build immunity to potentially harmful organisms that cause illness and disease. However, your body's immune system is already designed to do this in response to organisms which invade your body naturally.
Most disease-causing organisms enter your body through the mucous membranes of your nose, mouth, pulmonary system or your digestive tract – not through an injection.
These mucous membranes have their own immune system, called the IgA immune system. It is a different system from the one activated when a vaccine is injected into your body.
Your IgA immune system is your body's first line of defense. Its job is to fight off invading organisms at their entry points, reducing or even eliminating the need for activation of your body's immune system.
When a virus is injected into your body in a vaccine, and especially when combined with an immune adjuvant like squalene, your IgA immune system is bypassed and your body's immune system kicks into high gear in response to the vaccination.
Injecting organisms into your body to provoke immunity is contrary to nature, and vaccination carries enormous potential to do serious damage to your health.
And as if Vaccines Weren't Dangerous Enough on Their Own …
… imagine them turbocharged.
The main ingredient in a vaccine is either killed viruses or live ones that have been attenuated (weakened and made less harmful).
Flu vaccines can also contain a number of chemical toxins, including ethylene glycol (antifreeze), formaldehyde, phenol (carbolic acid) and even antibiotics like Neomycin and streptomycin.
In addition to the viruses and other additives, many vaccines also contain immune adjuvants like aluminum and squalene.
The purpose of an immune adjuvant added to a vaccine is to enhance (turbo charge) your immune response to the vaccination. Adjuvants cause your immune system to overreact to the introduction of the organism you're being vaccinated against.
Adjuvants are supposed to get the job done faster (but certainly not more safely), which reduces the amount of vaccine required per dose, and the number of doses given per individual.
Less vaccine required per person means more individual doses available for mass vaccination campaigns. Coincidentally, this is exactly the goal of government and the pharmaceutical companies who stand to make millions from their vaccines.
Will There Be Immune Adjuvants in Swine Flu Vaccines?
The U.S. government has contracts with several drug companies to develop and produce swine flu vaccines. At least two of those companies, Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline, are using an adjuvant in their H1N1 vaccines.
The adjuvant? Squalene.
According to Meryl Nass, M.D., an authority on the anthrax vaccine,
""A novel feature of the two H1N1 vaccines being developed by companies Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline is the addition of squalene-containing adjuvants to boost immunogenicity and dramatically reduce the amount of viral antigen needed. This translates to much faster production of desired vaccine quantities.""[v]
Novartis's proprietary squalene adjuvant for their H1N1 vaccine is MF59. Glaxo's is ASO3. MF59 has yet to be approved by the FDA for use in any U.S. vaccine, despite its history of use in other countries.
Per Dr. Nass, there are only three vaccines in existence using an approved squalene adjuvant. None of the three are approved for use in the U.S.
What Squalene Does to Rats
Oil-based vaccination adjuvants like squalene have been proved to generate concentrated, unremitting immune responses over long periods of time.[vi]
A 2000 study published in the American Journal of Pathology demonstrated a single injection of the adjuvant squalene into rats triggered ""chronic, immune-mediated joint-specific inflammation,"" also known as rheumatoid arthritis.[vii]
The researchers concluded the study raised questions about the role of adjuvants in chronic inflammatory diseases.
What Squalene Does to Humans
Your immune system recognizes squalene as an oil molecule native to your body. It is found throughout your nervous system and brain. In fact, you can consume squalene in olive oil and not only will your immune system recognize it, you will also reap the benefits of its antioxidant properties.
The difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" squalene is the route by which it enters your body. Injection is an abnormal route of entry which incites your immune system to attack all the squalene in your body, not just the vaccine adjuvant.
Your immune system will attempt to destroy the molecule wherever it finds it, including in places where it occurs naturally, and where it is vital to the health of your nervous system.[viii]
Gulf War veterans with Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) received anthrax vaccines which contained squalene.[ix] MF59 (the Novartis squalene adjuvant) was an unapproved ingredient in experimental anthrax vaccines and has since been linked to the devastating autoimmune diseases suffered by countless Gulf War vets.[x]
The Department of Defense made every attempt to deny that squalene was indeed an added contaminant in the anthrax vaccine administered to Persian Gulf war military personnel – deployed and non-deployed – as well as participants in the more recent Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program (AVIP).
However, the FDA discovered the presence of squalene in certain lots of AVIP product. A test was developed to detect anti-squalene antibodies in GWS patients, and a clear link was established between the contaminated product and all the GWS sufferers who had been injected with the vaccine containing squalene.
A study conducted at Tulane Medical School and published in the February 2000 issue of Experimental Molecular Pathology included these stunning statistics:
"" … the substantial majority (95%) of overtly ill deployed GWS patients had antibodies to squalene. All (100%) GWS patients immunized for service in Desert Shield/Desert Storm who did not deploy, but had the same signs and symptoms as those who did deploy, had antibodies to squalene.
In contrast, none (0%) of the deployed Persian Gulf veterans not showing signs and symptoms of GWS have antibodies to squalene. Neither patients with idiopathic autoimmune disease nor healthy controls had detectable serum antibodies to squalene. The majority of symptomatic GWS patients had serum antibodies to squalene.""[xi]
According to Dr. Viera Scheibner, Ph.D., a former principle research scientist for the government of Australia:
""… this adjuvant [squalene] contributed to the cascade of reactions called ""Gulf War Syndrome,"" documented in the soldiers involved in the Gulf War.
The symptoms they developed included arthritis, fibromyalgia, lymphadenopathy, rashes, photosensitive rashes, malar rashes, chronic fatigue, chronic headaches, abnormal body hair loss, non-healing skin lesions, aphthous ulcers, dizziness, weakness, memory loss, seizures, mood changes, neuropsychiatric problems, anti-thyroid effects, anaemia, elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Raynaud's phenomenon, Sjorgren's syndrome, chronic diarrhoea, night sweats and low-grade fevers.""[xii]
Post Vaccination Follow-Up Might as Well Be Non-Existent
There is virtually no science to support the safety of vaccine injections on your long-term health or the health of your children. Follow-up studies last on average about two weeks, and look only for glaring injuries and illnesses.
Autoimmune disorders like those seen in Gulf War Syndrome frequently take years to diagnose due to the vagueness of early symptoms. Complaints like headaches, fatigue and chronic aches and pains are symptoms of many different illnesses and diseases.
Don't hold your breath waiting for vaccine purveyors and proponents to look seriously at the long-term health consequences of their vaccination campaigns.
What You Can Do Right Now
Visit the National Vaccination Information Center (NVIC) site and join in the fight against mandatory swine flu vaccinations.
Educate yourself about influenza strains, vaccination risks, and the public health laws in your state that may require you or your children to undergo either mandatory vaccination or quarantine.
Take care of your health to reduce or eliminate your risk of contracting the flu. The key is to keep your immune system strong by following these guidelines:
Eliminate sugar and processed foods from your diet. Sugar consumption has an immediate, debilitating effect on your immune system.
Take a high quality source of animal-based omega 3 fats like Krill Oil.
Exercise. Your immune system needs good circulation in order to perform at its best for you.
Optimize your vitamin D levels. Vitamin D deficiency is the likely cause of seasonal flu viruses. Getting an optimal level of vitamin D will help you fight infections of all kinds.
Get plenty of good quality sleep.
Deal with stress effectively. If you feel overwhelmed by stress, your body will not have the reserves it needs to fight infection.
Wash your hands. But not with an antibacterial soap. Use a pure, non-toxic soap.

This presentation by the Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute includes a visual depiction of flu vaccine production -- how the flu vaccine is made and what it contains.
By Dr. Mercola
The video by Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute offers a good summary of what every person should know about the seasonal flu vaccine: how it's made, and its effectiveness.
Signs and Symptoms of Influenza
As most of you probably know, influenza is a contagious viral respiratory infection. Symptoms include:
Fever
Chills
Runny nose
Sore throat
Cough
Muscle aches
Fatigue
Decreased appetite
Typically, the condition will improve after two to three days of bed rest, although some symptoms may persist for about a week.
What many people do NOT know, however, is that death caused directly by the flu virus is very rare. The vast majority of so-called ""flu deaths"" are in fact due to bacterial pneumonia – a potential complication of the flu if your immune system is too weak.
Other complications can include ear or sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of chronic health conditions.
The elderly and people with other pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease, are at higher risk of developing pneumonia after a bout of the flu.
The Flu Vaccine Likely Does Not Prevent the Flu, nor Protect Against the Vast Majority of Flu-Related Deaths
The conventional treatment for bacterial pneumonia is an antibiotic, not a viral flu drug, so to think that taking a flu vaccine will prevent death from pneumonia doesn't really make sense.
""But the vaccine will prevent the flu, which will prevent the possibility of developing pneumonia,"" some might say.
That sounds good in theory, but the statistics simply do not support this assertion.
Because study after study, and master studies that compile the results from several studies to get a more objective result, keep coming to the same conclusion: Flu vaccines DO NOT WORK, and in many cases do more harm than good.
In fact, one shocking statistic brought to light in this video is that BEFORE the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocated vaccinating children under the age of five, the number of children dying from the flu was very low, and on the decline.
Then, in 2003, just after children aged five and under started getting vaccinated, the number of flu deaths SKYROCKETED. The death toll was enormous compared to the previous year, when the flu vaccine was not administered en masse to that age group!
How anyone can consider a strategy that yields a higher death toll to be a ""success"" is a mystery to me.
The Problem with Flu Death Statistics
However, as frightening as much of this may sound, it's important to keep things in perspective. According to the statistics shown in the video above, more Americans die from asthma, and even malnutrition each year, than the flu.
Unfortunately, the CDC grossly distorts the facts about flu deaths, making the flu virus seem far more dangerous than is warranted. On the CDC's main flu page1, they state that about 36,000 people die from the flu in the United States each year.

But if you search a little harder, you can find the actual number of people who died from the flu in 20052 (this is the most recent data that's available) was 1,806. The remainder was caused by pneumonia. In 2004, there were just 1,100 actual flu deaths.

The statistics the CDC gives are skewed partly because they classify those dying from pneumonia as dying from the flu, which is inaccurate.
How Is the Flu Vaccine Made?
This is another area that many people do not understand or take into consideration before getting a seasonal flu shot.
In January or February of each year, health authorities travel to Asia to determine which strains of the flu are currently active. Based on their findings in Asia, they assume that the same strains of viruses will spread to the U.S. by fall.
At this point, U.S. vaccine manufacturers start making that season's flu vaccine, which will contain the strains found in Asia. However, if the viral strains circulating in the U.S. that season are not identical to those in Asia, the vaccine you receive is a complete dud.
And to add insult to injury, you've just been injected with a laundry list of harmful ingredients.
What's in the Seasonal Flu Vaccine?
The flu strains selected are cultivated in chick embryos for several weeks before being inactivated with formaldehyde, which is a known cancer-causing agent. Then they're preserved with thimerosal, which is 49 percent mercury by weight.
Even many health care professionals are confused about this and are not aware that the preservative thimerosal is mercury. As a quick side note, one of my chief writers told me, ""the doctor's office told me the vaccine does not contain mercury, just something called thimerosal.""
Please, don't be fooled by this incredible ignorance. If you have carefully studied this issue, there is a great possibility you may know more than your physician about this topic. Don't back down if they tell you something you otherwise know to be true.
According to the CDC, the majority of flu vaccines contain thimerosal. Some contain as much as 25 mcg of mercury per dose. This means that it may contain more than 250 times the Environmental Protection Agency's safety limit for mercury.
By now, most people are well aware that children and fetuses are most at risk of damage from this neurotoxin, as their brains are still developing. Yet the CDC still recommends that children over six months, and pregnant women, receive the flu vaccine each year.
In addition to mercury, flu vaccines also contain other toxic or hazardous ingredients like:
Aluminum -- a neurotoxin that has been linked to Alzheimer's disease
Triton X-100 -- a detergent
Phenol (carbolic acid)
Ethylene glycol (antifreeze)
Betapropiolactone - a disinfectant
Nonoxynol - used to kill or stop growth of STDs
Octoxinol 9 - a vaginal spermicide
Sodium phosphate
How Safe Is the Flu Vaccine?
Serious reactions to the flu vaccine include, but are not limited to:
Life-threatening allergies to various ingredients
Guillain-Barre Syndrome (a severe paralytic disease that is fatal in about one in 20 cases)
Encephalitis (brain inflammation)
Neurological disorders
Thrombocytopenia (a serious blood disorder)
How Effective Is the Flu Vaccine?
Remember that the potential effectiveness of a flu vaccine is dependent on the ASSUMPTION, made nearly a year in advance, that Asia's viral strains will be the ones hitting the U.S. When they guess wrong, the vaccine is worthless from the very start.
But does that mean they withdraw the flu vaccine when they discover it contains the wrong strains? NO! They just keep giving it out anyway.
But even if they were to overcome that hurdle and actually select the correct strains, there's still no evidence that it does anyone any good to get a flu vaccine.
Study after study comes back showing the same dismal results: the flu vaccines are not an effective method of prevention of the flu, and they do not save lives. As mentioned earlier, they may even be responsible for an increased death rate in some groups.
Sometimes determining efficacy is as easy as reading the information coming straight from the vaccine manufacturer.
How about this quote taken directly from the flu vaccine FLULAVAL's package insert3 (which you likely never see when getting the flu shot) for the 2009-2010 formula:
"" FLULAVAL is an influenza virus vaccine indicated for active immunization of adults 18 years of age and older against influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and type B contained in the vaccine. This indication is based on immune response elicited by FLULAVAL, and there have been no controlled trials demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with FLULAVAL.""
That's right, NO controlled trials demonstrating ANY decrease in your risk of contracting the flu at all after vaccination! (It also states that each dose contains a total of 25 mcg of mercury.)
For those of you who are still unconvinced, know that there's plenty of scientific evidence available to back up the recommendation to avoid flu vaccines. In addition to studies mentioned in the video, here are several other examples showing that flu vaccines do not work for any age group:
A study published in the October 2008 issue of the Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine4 found that vaccinating young children against the flu had no impact on flu-related hospitalizations or doctor visits during two recent flu seasons.
The researchers concluded that ""significant influenza vaccine effectiveness could not be demonstrated for any season, age, or setting"" examined.
A 2008 study published in the Lancet5 found that influenza vaccination was NOT associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia in older people.
This supports an earlier study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Research published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine6 also confirms that there has been no decrease in deaths from influenza and pneumonia in the elderly, despite the fact that vaccination coverage among the elderly has increased from 15 percent in 1980 to 65 percent now. In 2007, researchers with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious.
Diseases, and the National Institutes of Health published this conclusion in the Lancet Infectious Diseases7: ""We conclude that frailty selection bias and use of non-specific endpoints such as all-cause mortality,have led cohort studies to greatly exaggerate vaccine benefits.""
A large-scale, systematic review of 51 studies, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews8 in 2006, found no evidence that the flu vaccine is any more effective than a placebo in children under two. The studies involved 260,000 children, age six to 23 months.
Last but not least, I think it says a lot that 70 percent of doctors and nurses, and 62 percent of other health care workers do NOT get the yearly flu shot 62 percent of other health care workers do NOT get the yearly flu shot.9
The reasons why they opted to not get vaccinated were:
They didn't believe the vaccine would work
They believed their immune systems were strong enough to withstand exposure to the flu
They were concerned about side effects
Might Influenza Be Little More Than a Symptom of Vitamin D Deficiency?
Vitamin D, ""the sunshine vitamin,"" may very well be one of the most beneficial vitamins there is for disease prevention. Unfortunately, it's also one of the vitamins that a vast majority of people across the world are deficient in due to lack of regular exposure to sunshine.
Published in the journal Epidemiology and Infection10 in 2006, the hypothesis presented by Dr. John Cannell and colleagues in the paper Epidemic Influenza and Vitamin D11 raises the possibility that influenza is a symptom of vitamin D deficiency.
The vitamin D formed when your skin is exposed to sunlight regulates the expression of more than 2,000 genes throughout your body, including ones that influence your immune system to attack and destroy bacteria and viruses. Hence, being overwhelmed by the ""flu bug"" could signal that your vitamin D levels are too low, allowing the flu virus to overtake your immune system.
At least five studies show an inverse association between lower respiratory tract infections and 25(OH)D levels. That is, the higher your vitamin D level, the lower your risk of contracting colds, flu, and other respiratory tract infections:
A 2007 study12 suggests higher vitamin D status enhances your immunity to microbial infections. They found that subjects with vitamin D deficiency had significantly more days of absence from work due to respiratory infection than did control subjects.
A 2009 study13 on vitamin D deficiency in newborns with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) confirmed a strong, positive correlation between newborns' and mother's vitamin D levels. Over 87 percent of all newborns and over 67 percent of all mothers had vitamin D levels lower than 20 ng/ml, which is a severe deficiency state.
Newborns with vitamin D deficiency appear to have an increased risk of developing ALRI, and since the child's vitamin D level strongly correlates with its mother's, the researchers recommend that all mothers' optimize their vitamin D levels during pregnancy, especially in the winter months, to safeguard their baby's health.
A similar Indian study14 published in 2004 also reported that vitamin D deficiency in infants significantly raised their odds ratio for having severe ALRI.
A 2009 analysis of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey15 examined the association between vitamin D levelsand recent upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in nearly 19,000 subjects over the age of 12.
Recent URTI was reported by:
17 percent of participants with vitamin D levels of 30ng/ml or higher
20 percent of participants with vitamin D levels between 10-30 ng/ml.
24 percent of participants with vitamin D levels below 10ng/ml
The positive correlation between lower vitamin D levels and increased risk of URTI was even stronger in individuals with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Another 2009 report16 in the journal Pediatric Research stated that infants and children appear more susceptible to viral rather than bacterial infections when deficient in vitamin D. And that, based on the available evidence showing a strong connection between vitamin D, infections, and immune function in children, vitamin D supplementation may be a valuable therapy in pediatric medicine.
How to Help Prevent the Flu Without Getting a Flu Shot
For most people the flu shot does not make you healthy; it does just the opposite and weakens your immune system.
If you follow a healthy lifestyle, you will not have to worry about getting the flu. Take it from me -- I've never received a flu shot, and I haven't missed a day of work due to illness in over 20 years. The key steps that I follow to stay flu-free, include:
Get plenty of sunshine, safe tanning bed exposure, or an oral supplement for optimal vitamin D3
Eat right for your nutritional type, including avoiding sugar
Exercise
Get adequate sleep
Address emotional stress
Wash your hands regularly"

And yet obesity figures have risen dramatically in the same period.

The Time magazine article linked below asks the question -- Since many people get hungry after they exercise and eat more, could exercise actually be keeping them from losing weight?

""In general, for weight loss, exercise is pretty useless,"" says Eric Ravussin, chair in diabetes and metabolism at Louisiana State University and a prominent exercise researcher.
Many recent studies have found that exercise isn't as important in helping people lose weight as you hear so regularly in gym advertisements or on shows like The Biggest Loser -- or, for that matter, from magazines like Time.
The basic problem is that while it's true that exercise burns calories and that you must burn calories to lose weight, exercise has another effect: it can stimulate hunger. That causes us to eat more, which in turn can negate the weight-loss benefits we just accrued. Exercise, in other words, isn't necessarily helping us lose weight. It may even be making it harder."

The CDC did not realize they discovered this. However, anyone familiar with the Vitamin D literature will recognize it.
Almost two-thirds of the dead children had epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or other neurodevelopmental conditions like mental retardation.
All of these neurological conditions are associated with childhood Vitamin D deficiency. Exacerbating the problem further, many of these kids take anticonvulsant drugs, which lower Vitamin D levels.
58 million American children are Vitamin D deficient; 7.6 million are severely deficient.
When researchers looked at more than 6,000 American kids (age one to 21) who were carefully selected to be representative of the average American child. 9 percent of the kids had 25(OH)D levels less than 15 ng/mL and 70 percent had levels less than 30 ng/mL.
Vitamin D Dose Recommendations
Age Dosage
Below 5 35 units per pound per day
Age 5 - 10 2500 units
Adults 5000 units
Pregnant Women 5000 units
WARNING: There is no way to know if the above recommendations are correct. The ONLY way to know is to test your blood. You might need 4-5 times the amount recommended above. Ideally your blood level of 25 OH D should be 60ng/ml.
As the advent of the experimental swine flu vaccine program draws near, I want to highlight the information coming out that confirms the importance of having sufficient vitamin D levels in order to limit your chances of contracting the swine flu, or any other influenza for that matter.
Dr. Cannell, who is a leader in the field of vitamin D research and education, points out that the CDC unwittingly supports the theory that your vitamin D levels likely play an equally important role in the swine flu as in other types of seasonal flu.
According to the CDC’s statistics, the H1N1 flu has killed 36 children in U.S., and of those, almost two-thirds had either epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or some other neurodevelopmental condition like mental retardation.
All of these neurological conditions are associated with childhood vitamin D deficiency, Dr. Cannell observed, which could also have made them far more susceptible to flu complications.
The Connection Between Your Vitamin D Levels and Contracting the Flu
Previously, Dr. Cannell has published a very credible hypothesis that explains the seasonal nature of the flu.
His findings were first published in the journal Epidemiology and Infection two years ago, followed up with another study published in the Virology Journal last year.
His hypothesis was then confirmed by another study -- the largest and most nationally representative of its kind to date -- that involved about 19,000 Americans. It too found that people with the lowest blood vitamin D levels reported having significantly more recent colds or cases of the flu.
The positive correlation between lower vitamin D levels and increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections was even more pronounced in individuals with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Part of the explanation is that vitamin D creates over 200 antimicrobial peptides in your body that serve as natural broad-spectrum antibiotics, so when your vitamin D levels fall, you also reduce your natural capacity to ward off colds, influenza and other respiratory infections.
During flu seasons, vitamin D levels in your blood are typically at their lowest point due to lack of exposure to sunshine.
At least four other recent studies show this inverse association between lower respiratory tract infections and 25(OH)D levels. That is, the higher your vitamin D level, the lower your risk of contracting colds, flu, and other respiratory tract infections:
A 2007 study suggests higher vitamin D status enhances your immunity to microbial infections. They found that subjects with vitamin D deficiency had significantly more days of absence from work due to respiratory infection than did control subjects.
A 2009 study on vitamin D deficiency in newborns with acute lower respiratory infection confirmed a strong, positive correlation between newborns' and mothers' vitamin D levels. Over 87 percent of all newborns and over 67 percent of all mothers had vitamin D levels lower than 20 ng/ml, which is a severe deficiency state.
Newborns with vitamin D deficiency appear to have an increased risk of developing ALRI, and since the child’s vitamin D level strongly correlates with its mother’s, the researchers recommend that all mothers optimize their vitamin D levels during pregnancy, especially in the winter months, to safeguard their babies' health.
A similar Indian study published in 2004 also reported that vitamin D deficiency in infants significantly raised their odds ratio for having severe ALRI.
Another 2009 report in the journal Pediatric Research stated that infants and children appear more susceptible to viral rather than bacterial infections when deficient in vitamin D. And that, based on the available evidence showing a strong connection between vitamin D, infections, and immune function in children, vitamin D supplementation may be a valuable therapy in pediatric medicine.
Most American Children and Teenagers are Vitamin D Deficient
It’s been shown that vitamin D deficiency in American teens is very common. According to one recent study, only 25 percent of more than 3,500 teenagers, aged 12 to 19, had levels higher than 26 ng/ml, and 25 percent had levels lower than 15 ng/ml, which is a severe deficiency state.
And in another study that included 6,000 American kids between the ages of one to 21, 9 percent had vitamin D levels less than 15 ng/mL, and 70 percent had less than 30 ng/mL.
As you may recall, the optimal level of vitamin D is far higher than the conventionally recommended level of 30 ng/ml.
Ranges calculated based on the values of healthy people in tropical or subtropical parts of the world, where they are receiving healthy sun exposures, shows that your optimal vitamin D level is likely to be in the 50-65 ng/ml range.
Canada Leads the Pack, Studying Vitamin D’s Impact on Swine Flu
After studying the role of vitamin D in severe seasonal influenza, Canada’s Public Health Agency (PHAC) has confirmed that it will now adapt their research to investigate the role of vitamin D in protection against swine flu.
Unfortunately, it may take years before we see the results of their findings, and in the meantime, little or nothing will be done to promote vitamin D by conventional medicine.
I strongly suggest you don’t wait for their results to come in, as there is already abundant evidence showing that your vitamin D levels play a role in your likelihood of getting the flu.
Also, let’s not forget the fact that there is also abundant evidence showing that flu vaccines do NOT protect you from the flu, and one recent study found it had no impact on pediatric flu-related hospitalizations or doctor visits during the flu seasons studied. In fact, the researchers concluded that ""significant influenza vaccine effectiveness could not be demonstrated for any season, age, or setting.""
In addition, a systematic review of 51 studies involving 260,000 children age 6 to 23 months also found no evidence that the flu vaccine is any more effective than a placebo.
So if hedging bets, I would bet that optimizing your vitamin D levels will offer far greater advantages and protection than getting a flu shot – whether it’s a seasonal flu vaccine or a swine flu vaccine.
You Can Use Vitamin D to Treat the Flu, Too
If you were to maintain your vitamin D levels within the optimal range of 50-65 ng/ml, you would likely avoid being affected during the cold and flu season entirely.
That said, if you are coming down with flu-like symptoms and have not been on vitamin D you can take doses of 50,000 units a day for three days to treat the acute infection. Some researchers like Dr. Cannell believe the dose could even be as high as 1,000 units per pound of body weight for three days.
Ultimately, your best bet – not just for cold and flu prevention, but for the prevention of an astounding number of common and often chronic diseases – is to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D year-round.
To find out even more important information about vitamin D, I strongly recommend you watch my one-hour free vitamin D lecture along with my video on vitamin D’s role in flu prevention."

Analysis of material by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by Dr. Russell Blaylock. (September 5, 2009)
Critical Observations:
Doctor visits for flu are down from the level in April
Total flu hospitalizations are similar or lower than for seasonal flu (yearly flu)
The number of death secondary to flu and pneumonia is unchanged from yearly rate
Only two states are reporting widespread infections -- Georgia and Alaska. Other states report only regional or sporadic activity, meaning it’s not very contagious.
There is no evidence that the virus has mutated at all anywhere in the world
The virus remains susceptible to the drugs Tamiflu and Relenza.
Only 43,771 cases have been reported in the United States. Because of poor reporting the CDC estimates that true numbers indicate that one million have been infected. Many people did not get sick enough to go to a doctor. Likewise, not all people are tested who go to a doctor.
Of these 5,011 have been hospitalized and 302 have died.
Death Rates From the H1N1 Flu
If we use the 43,771 figure and 302 deaths that means the death rate is 0.6 percent, an extremely low death rate for any flu.
The percentage of hospitalized patients who died was 6 percent, again a very low incidence of death.
Since the CDC estimates that one million have been infected, we must recalculate death rates. Using this more accurate figure, the death rate is in truth 0.03 percent, which means 99.97percent will not die from this flu. Your chances of dying are incredibly low.
Age and Death Rates
We hear a lot about the unusual age distribution with this virus, especially as regards death rates, with the young being more affected than, as with seasonal flu, the elderly (90% of deaths are usually among those greater than 65 years old). The risks of becoming infected are as follows:
Ages 5 to 24 y/o--------26.7 per 100,000 (0.027%)
Ages 0 to 4 y/o ---------22.9 per 100,000 (0.023%)
Ages 25 to 49-----------6.97 per 100,000 (0.0069%)
Ages 50 to 64 y/o------3.9 per 100,000 (0.0039)
Over 65 y/o-------------1.3 per 1000,000 (0.00013%)
And the risk of needing to be hospitalized are:
Ages 0 to 4 y/o---------0.0045%
Ages 5 to 24 y/o--------0.0021%
Ages 25 to 45 y/o------0.0011%
Over 65 y/o-------------0.0017%
This indicates that for all age groups, the risk of being hospitalized are far less than 1 percent and well over 99 percent of people will not need hospitalization.
This explains why this infection is being downplayed by the virologists themselves, the ones who know most about the dangers of viruses.
The distributions of death also vary considerably by age. Below is the distribution of deaths according to age.
Ages 25-49 y/o---------41%
Ages 50 to 64 y/o-----24%
Ages 5 to 24 y/o------16%
Over age 65 y/o------- 9%
Ages 0 to 4 y/o-------- 2%
So, we see that the greatest death rates in the extremely small fraction that die are between ages 25 to 49 and 65 percent are between ages 25 to 64.
The least likely to die are babies up to age 4 years, yet they are targeted for vaccination and as we see from the above data, children below age 2 years get absolutely no protection from the flu vaccines.
Analysis of the New Government Projections to the Media
If we analyzed it according to the worst case scenario released by the government we see far lower figures than being projected:
They say 150 million Americans will be infected. That is 150 X as many as now infected, and represents a much larger figure than now estimated with a 6 to 6.5 percent of a localized population.
For the United States itself with a population slightly over 300 million, their figures indicate a 50 percent infection rate. There is nothing to indicate such a high infectivity rate from the past 7 months of analysis.
It should also be appreciated that the infections will not occur all at once, but will slowly evolve, as we have seen thus far, meaning that at any one time a much smaller amount of Americans will be infected -- which also reduces the numbers who will require hospitalizations at any one time, and who will need ICU care.
As far as the number that will need hospitalization, the government now says there will be 1.8 million people hospitalized, of which 300,000 may need ICU treatment.
If we use the existing data we see that the numbers are quite different. At the time the data was taken, 303 people out of one million infected died and 5,011 needed hospitalization. This means a projected hospitalization incidence of 750,000 and a death rate of 45,000 deaths. Remember, this is using their data applied to the outrageously high figure of 50% of the population being infected -- that is, 150 million people.
If the infection rate is 6 percent, as all the studies have shown thus far, we see much smaller numbers.
Instead of 150 million infected we see 18 million infected. Using these more realistic figures we can estimate a hospitalization rate of 90,000 and a projected death incidence of 5436.
Again, it is important to keep in mind that the infections will be evolving and not all at once as both sets of figures seem to imply. If we spread this over several months and waves of the infection, we see that at any one time the hospitalizations will be a much smaller number, as will the deaths.
Thus far, there have been nationwide 2,000 hospitalizations a month and 99 deaths a month.
Certainly the hospitals in the United States can handle the increase. In the United States we have 5,759 hospitals containing 955,000 beds and 70,000 ICU beds. Most hospitalized people will not require intensive care. Most are suffering from dehydration and only required IV fluid infusion.
It should also be appreciated that most pediatric deaths and elderly deaths will occur early in the epidemic because the chronically ill and immune suppressed will become infected early. Therefore one would expect the deaths to rise initially and then fall as the infection spreads as we see from this graph:
In this chart we see that the hospitalization rates are actually lower for the swine flu than in previous seasons.
In this graph we see that the hospitalization rates were either lower or barely above the seasonal flu admissions in the previous two years.
We can see from the CDC’s own data that the hospitalization rates and death rates are no higher, in fact they are significantly lower, than the previous two to three flu seasons.
It is obvious that the government is using “scare tactics” to promote vaccine use in the United States and that the pharmaceutical makers of vaccines are in bed with these officials.
The public should be outraged.
Why Do Some Die From Such a Mild Virus?
As stated by the virologists, this virus is no more a danger than the seasonal virus that visits each year and actually seems to be much weaker.
One may also note from the CDC’s own data, the previous nonsense about 36,000 dying from the seasonal flu every year is pure fiction. We have had a little over 400 deaths nationwide over the past 5 months, nowhere near the 36,000 figure screamed from the airwaves and our TV sets, yet the public is in a state of panic.
So, why are some dying from this virus?
What is little understood by the general public is that the only reason people die from the flu is that they have either an immune suppressing chronic illness, such as diabetes, direct immune dysfunction, dietary deficiencies of critical immune-supporting nutrients, chronic pulmonary disease, heart disease or cancer.
Smoking powerfully suppresses immunity as well as damages lungs, and we know that smokers are much more likely to suffer complications and die than non-smokers.
Excess dietary omega-6 fats (corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, peanut and canola oils) also severely weaken immunity. The EPA component of omega-3 oils also powerfully suppresses immunity.
A study by the CDC found that 32 percent of children dying from H1N1 flu had asthma, when the incidence of asthma in the general population was 8 percent. Two thirds of the children who died had neurological disorders, such as seizures and cerebral palsy.
So, the vast majority of children who are dying have one of a number of chronic health conditions, yet the media gives us the impression that perfectly healthy children are dying.
A recent study of why so many died during the 1918 flu pandemic found that most of the deaths were secondary to bacterial pneumonia and not the flu virus itself. In 1918 hospitals had little to offer a sick patient -- there were no antibiotics, other than sulfur drugs, no IV fluids and no respirators -- all they could offer was a warm bed and aspirin.
It was also disclosed that the number of flu-related deaths among children was lower this year than the previous two years.
What are the Virologists Saying?
Virologists are scientists who study viruses -- their classification, their genetics, methods of spread and their ability to cause disease. No one knows more about this virus than the virologists.
The British science magazine, The New Scientist, recently polled 60 virologists to get their opinion. These are the results of specific questions:
Will the virulent version of the virus appear?
Extremely likely-----------------none
Likely----------------------------5
A 50/50 chance----------------- 14
Possible-------------------------- 38
Not at all--------------------------3
What the virologists are doing personally
Stock Tamiflu or Relinza-----------------14
Stock above plus antibiotics------------- 6
Stock food, water and power source----5
Get pneumococcal vaccine---------------3
Nothing------------------------------------ 30
Hand washing, mask, etc--------------- 3
Notice there was no mention of taking the swine flu vaccine.
Behind the push to vaccinate the entire population are the pharmaceutical makers of the vaccines, who are working in conjunction with the government to make the vaccine mandatory.
Homeland security and FEMA are pushing for forced vaccinations and the medical experts, virologists and epidemiologists are calling for calm and resorting to voluntary vaccination only. The former have links with the vaccine manufacturers via political contacts. A great deal of money will be made by the manufacturers, should forced vaccinations be mandated.
Will This Vaccine Be Tested?
According to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 5 tests are planned. It is not clear as to the use of the squalene adjuvants, ASO3 and MF-59.
Squalene Update as of October 2009:

According to Barbara Loe Fisher, founder of the NVIC, none of the H1N1 vaccines being distributed in the United States contain squalene or other oil in water adjuvants.

We successfully made enough fuss about the potential danger of fast tracking licensure of squalene adjuvants into US H1N1 vaccines under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that can be invoked during a declared public health emergency that the FDA has NOT licensed these adjuvants for the U.S.

There is squalene in H1N1 vaccines licensed in Europe but not yet in the U.S. That is not to say the vaccine manufacturers will not try to get the adjuvants inserted into vaccines in the future, but for now we have won on this point.
Because of concerns raised, the FDA is now hedging. Independent studies of squalene used as a vaccine adjuvant indicates that it is associated with a very high incidence of autoimmune diseases, such as an MS-like neurological syndrome, rheumatoid joint disease and especially Lupus.
The developer of MF-59 is Chiron pharmaceuticals, which was purchased by Novartis pharmaceutical company, who will be the main supplier of the swine flu vaccine for the world. According to Dr. Fauci, testing in both children and adults will be without this adjuvant and he admits that we have no data on the safety in children.(See Nature Vol 460/30 July 2009, p 562 for the interview.)
There are 5 tests scheduled for safety before mass vaccinations will resume. I looked up on clinicaltrials.gov the actual studies being done. It is instructive to note that the only studies actually being done do not contain any adjuvant (the immune booster) either for babies or adults. Yet, when the mass vaccinations begin, the vaccines will have adjuvant added, possibly squalene.
The real irony here is that this is the same bait and switch game they played in the 1976 swine flu vaccine disaster.
They tested one vaccine and gave a different one during the mass vaccinations.
Here we go again. Over 500 people were paralyzed with Guillain-Barre disorder. The incidence was much higher, because it was not a reportable disease. And over 300 people died, which is also a very low figure.
Dr. Fauci admits that they have no idea what will happen when they mix the three viruses from the vaccines together or when they are given sequentially. When he was asked if the results of the studies would be reviewed by the health authorities, he answered, “yes, except for those done by the Novartis company.”
He justified this secrecy by saying that Norvartis had a very advanced testing system, which was done “in-house” -- that is, in secrecy.
It is also important to appreciate that this vaccine has been fast-tracked, meaning that many of the usual safety precautions used to prevent contamination of the vaccines will be overlooked by the regulatory agencies.
According to a number of studies, vaccine contamination is widespread, with vaccines containing pestivirus, mycoplasma, viral fragments, DNA fragments and bacterial components, all of which can produce chronic systemic disorders, cancer, neurologic diseases and even slow brain degeneration.
The Following was composed by Dr. Russell Blaylock as a method to reduce autoimmune reactions to the flu vaccines only. Do not use this if you have the flu itself. These are just general observations and not medical advice. You should work with your doctor for a specific program.
Treatment for Toxic Vaccine Exposure
Place a cold compress on the site of the injection immediately after the injection and continue this as often as possible for at least two days. If symptoms of fever, irritability, fatigue or flu-like symptoms reoccur -- continue the cold compresses until they abate. A cold shower or bath will also help.
Take krill oil as a source of animal based omega-3 fats.
Curcumin, quercetin, ferulic acid and ellagic acid as a mixture -- the first two must be mixed with extravirgin olive in one teaspoon. Take the mix three times a day (500 mg of each)
Vitamin E (natural form) 400 IU a day (high in gamma-E)
Vitamin C 1000 mg four times a day
Astaxanthin 4 mg a day
Zinc 20 mg a day for one week then 5 mg a day
Avoid all immune stimulating supplements (mushroom extracts, whey protein) except beta-glucan -- it has been shown to reduce inflammation, microglial activation and has a reduced risk of aggravating autoimmunity, while increasing antiviral cellular immunity.
Take a multivitamin/mineral daily (one without iron -- Extend Core)
Magnesium citrate/malate 500 mg of elemental magnesium two capsules three times a day
Vitamin D3:
All Children -- 5000 IU a day for two weeks after vaccine then 2000 IU a day thereafter
Adults -- 20,000 IU a day after vaccine for two weeks then 10,000 IU a day thereafter
Take 500 mg to 1000 mg of calcium citrate a day for adults and 250 mg a day for children under age 12 years.
Avoid all mercury-containing seafood
Avoid omega-6 oils (corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, canola and peanut oils)
Blenderize parsley and celery and drink 8 ounces twice a day
Take Jatoba tea extract (add 20 drops in on cup of tea) one day before the vaccine and the twice a day thereafter. (you can get it at http://www.iherb.com/Amazon-Therapeutics-Jatoba-1-oz-30-ml/14429?at=0) It is inexpensive."
"153","https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/09/19/inconvenient-truths-about-gardasil-and-swine-flu-vaccines.aspx","September 19, 2009","Inconvenient Truths About Gardasil and Swine Flu Vaccines","The summer of 2009 revealed two inconvenient truths about vaccination. First, the Gardasil vaccine is not as safe as the government, medical organizations and Merck have said it is. Second, the H1N1 influenza pandemic is not as serious as health officials are telling you it is.
One in every 1,855 Gardasil shots is followed by a bad health outcome report to the government’s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. These bad health outcomes reported after Gardasil shots include lots of girls suddenly passing out and having seizures.
There is also a greater than expected rate of reported blood clots. In fact, four girls have died after they developed a blood clot that traveled to their lungs after Gardasil vaccination.
Apparently, the government can let vaccine manufacturers fast track the Gardasil vaccine, but can’t compel the drug company that makes the vaccine, or doctors giving it, to report each and every death and serious injury that follows vaccination. Why believe anything government health officials tell us about the safety of vaccines? Why believe that the experimental swine flu vaccines being fast tracked with only a few weeks of study are going to be safe, and that all vaccine reactions will be reported to the government and then properly followed up?
It is far more likely that, when children get swine flu vaccine in schools and then get really sick or even die like the Gardasil girls, that all those bad health outcomes will be written off as a coincidence by health officials. That is, if any reports are made to the government at all -- few school nurses or other people giving children swine flu vaccines in the schools will be taking medical histories, much less monitoring children for signs of a vaccine reaction and then filing a reaction report to the government.
It is time to demand that government officials and drug companies stop conducting national vaccine experiments on the American people."

Secret #1: Your dentist may not be as educated as you think.
Dentistry has changed a lot since your dentist graduated from dental school. There have been major advances in most materials used in fillings, bonding and root canals. If your dentist is not actively engaged in continuing education, it is unlikely that he or she is keeping up with these developments.
Secret #2: Your dentist may not have the latest technology.
Digital x-ray: Dentists who do not have digital x-ray equipment are practicing in the dark ages. Digital x-rays use less radiation than film. They are easier to read and the ability to manipulate contrast makes diagnosis more accurate.
Ultrasonic Cleaning: Ultrasonic instruments vibrate plaque and calculus off your teeth, even in areas below your gums. It is much more comfortable than old-fashioned hand scraping.
CEREC: The CEREC system lets your dentist provide a ceramic crown or veneer in only one visit. CEREC means fewer injections, less drilling and no annoying temporaries.
Diagnodent: This is a laser that the dentist shines on the tooth and it tells whether there is a cavity and how deep it is. With the use of this technology, the dentist can detect cavities, and find them at an earlier stage, than traditional poking around the tooth.
Secret #3: Your dentist may be using mercury.
Mercury is toxic. Norway and Sweden have banned the use of mercury fillings.. But mercury fillings are less expensive and easier for the dentist to use. If your dentist does not use composite fillings, don't go to that dentist any more. In the US, the FDA is way behind the ball and not actively warning patients about this like they have been mandated by the courts to do.
Secret #4: The lab may be more important than your dentist.
Dental labs create dentures, crowns, bridges, orthodontic appliances, and other dental restorations like implant crowns. There is a huge difference in the quality of these labs. You should be particularly wary if your dentist is using a lab in China or Mexico. Some of the top labs in the U.S. are Aurum Ceramics, MicroDental Laboratories, da Vinci Dental Studio, and Williams Dental Lab.
Secret #5: There's more to good dentistry than filling cavities.
A competent dentist screens for more than tooth decay. He or she should be concerned about sleep apnea, jaw-related pain known as TMJ or temporomandibular joint disorder, periodontal disease, oral cancer, diabetes and hypertension.
Secret #6: You are probably using the wrong specialist for dental implants.
Since dental implants involve the removal of a tooth and replacing it with an artificial tooth, many patients assume that an oral surgeon is best qualified to do it. This can be a flawed assumption. Periodontists, who specialize in gum disease, may be a better option. Periodontists have special training in gum tissue and underlying bone in the mouth, which are significant issues in dental implants.
Secret #7: Bad dental advice about dentures can be fatal!
Dentures are no joke. Your dentist should examine your dentures for evidence of wear. Wearing down the teeth on your dentures can result in distorted facial characteristics, collapse of the bite and closure of the airway.
Secret #8: Your dentist may not know enough about sleep apnea.
The most common form of sleep apnea is caused by a blockage of the airway during sleep. It is a pretty scary condition. The patient can stop breathing hundreds of times during the night. A common treatment for sleep apnea is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), which involves blowing pressurized room air through the airway at high enough pressure to keep the airway open.
As an alternative, your dentist, working with your physician, can custom make a device that guides the lower jaw forward, called a mandibular advancement device or MAD. MAD devices are more comfortable to wear and the compliance rates are much higher than using CPAP.
Secret #9: Not all cosmetic dentists have the skills to really improve your smile.
Any dentist can call herself a ""cosmetic dentist."" Your dentist should be able to show you ten or more before and after photographs or videos, and be willing to give you the names of patients who have consented to be used as references.
Secret #10: How to avoid the root canal your dentist says you need.
Ask about the ""ferrule effect."" Technically, this means that a root canal is unlikely to be successful if there is not enough tooth structure above the gum line to protect the tooth from coming loose or fracturing after it has been prepared for a crown.

When you start feeling a throbbing pain in your abdomen, one of the first things you would likely start blaming is your appendix, regardless of whether the pain is emanating from. But do you know which side the appendix is on?
Your appendix is a slimy sac that hangs between your small and large intestines. It's usually located in the lower right side of the abdomen, but may also be located on the left side in very rare cases. This reverse placement usually indicates a condition called ""situs inversus.""1
The appendix has long been thought of as a worthless evolutionary artifact, good for nothing except a potentially lethal case of inflammation. But now researchers suggest that your appendix is a lot more than a useless remnant.
Not only was it recently proposed to actually possess a critical function, but scientists now find it appears in nature a lot more often than they had thought. And it's possible some of this organ's ancient uses could be recruited by physicians to help the human body fight disease more effectively.
Your appendix may serve as a vital safe house where good bacteria can lie in wait until they are needed to repopulate the gut after a case of diarrhea. Past studies have also found the appendix can help make, direct and train white blood cells.
The appendix appears in nature much more often than previously acknowledged. It appears in Australian marsupials such as the wombat and in rats, lemmings, meadow voles, and other rodents, as well as humans and certain primates.
Appendicitis, or an infected appendix, can be fatal. According to the CDC, over 320,000 people are hospitalized each year, and up to 400 Americans die due to appendicitis.
Until recently, the appendix was believed to be nothing more than an ancient remnant; a useless organ that served no purpose in your body, and for this reason alone, surgeons have routinely removed them.
However, recent research has discovered that this is not true.
As common sense dictates, there is a purpose for every organ in your body, even the ones that modern medicine can’t figure out, and your appendix is one of them.
How Does Your Appendix Promote Health?
A previous study published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology found that your appendix serves as a “backup factory” for beneficial commensal bacteria, the symbiotic germs that aid digestion and help protect your body against disease-causing germs.
If the good bacteria in your colon dies, which could happen as a result of cholera or dysentery for instance, it appears your appendix steps up to help recolonize your gut with good bacteria.
Modern society has become so hypervigilant against bacteria that many forget a very important point -- The bacteria in your body actually outnumber your cells by about ten to one, and without them you would die.
For example, the friendly bacteria that reside in your gut have a number of very important functions, such as:
Digesting and absorbing certain carbohydrates. Without good gut bacteria, your body cannot absorb certain undigested starches, fiber, and sugars. The friendly bacteria in your digestive tract convert these carbohydrates into primary sources of important energy and nutrients.
Producing vitamins, absorbing minerals and eliminating toxins. Probiotics help in the production of both vitamin K and B vitamins, and promote mineral absorption. They also aid in metabolism and the breakdown of toxins.
Keeping bad bacteria under control. A large part of the influence of the ""bad"" bacteria is on your intestinal lining (mucousal barrier). Simply stated, friendly bacteria compete with the bad guys for room and board, but since beneficial bacteria are more at home there, they win most of the battles for nutrition and attachment sites within your colon.
The good bacteria tell your body how much nutrition they need and your body responds by supplying just that much and no more - so that any excess bad bacteria are starved out. The helpful bacteria also produce a substance that kills harmful microbes.
Preventing allergies. Friendly bacteria train your immune system to distinguish between pathogens and non-harmful antigens, and to respond appropriately. This important function prevents your immune system from overreacting to non-harmful antigens, which is the genesis of allergies.
Providing vital support to your immune system. Beneficial bacteria have a lifelong, powerful effect on your gut’s immune system and your systemic immune system as well. The bacteria play a crucial role in the development and operation of the mucosal immune system in your digestive tract. They also aid in the production of antibodies to pathogens.
It’s also important to remember that 80 percent of your immune system is located in your digestive system, making a healthy gut a major focal point if you want to maintain optimal health.
A robust immune system is your number one defense system against disease.
Modern Lifestyle Does Not Negate the Need for Your Appendix
Researchers have speculated that despite the beneficial influence of the appendix, most people living in the modern world don’t need it because you can easily repopulate the good bacteria in your gut.
I do not agree with this assessment because your good bacteria is constantly being assaulted by antibiotics, chlorinated water, birth control pills, stress, sugar, and a host of other environmental factors.
Gastrointestinal problems are in fact a very common concern for a majority of Americans.
Ideally, your gut should contain a ratio of 85 percent good bacteria to 15 percent non-beneficial bacteria, but the factors I listed above have actually caused this ratio to reverse in many people.
This is why I often recommend that you use a high-quality probiotic as an “insurance policy” to make sure your body remains balanced with good strains of bacteria, particularly if you don’t lead a perfectly healthy lifestyle.
It’s also worth keeping in mind that this is still just the beginning as far as what scientists know about the appendix. It may turn out to have other far-reaching but subtle effects on your body function than what is currently known.
After all, scientists have now discovered that more than 70 percent of all primate and rodent groups contain certain species with an appendix. If its purpose was so inconsequential, why would so many different species have it?
So far, at least one negative side effect of having your appendix removed (called an appendectomy) has been uncovered -- an increased risk of Crohn’s disease. So please, don’t fall for the advice to have your appendix removed simply because “it has no purpose.”
When Should You Agree to Have Your Appendix Removed?
Naturally, there are times when an appendectomy is warranted. If your appendix becomes infected or inflamed, failing to remove it could be fatal.
Just don’t agree to have your appendix removed for no other reason than you’re having an unrelated abdominal surgery performed, which happens more frequently than you might think.
Major warning signs that your appendix might be a problem include:
You have absolutely no appetite, even for your most favorite foods.
You have pain that started around your belly button and has moved to your lower right abdominal area.
You have pain when jumping up and down. First, jump up and down gently. If there is no pain, try jumping higher. This will move your peritoneal cavity and if it is irritated with an inflamed appendix, the movement will cause considerable pain.
If you have all of the above symptoms you should be evaluated at your nearest emergency room.
If you are a woman, you may benefit from receiving a CT scan or ultrasound prior to having an appendectomy. A study published in the journal Radiology found that in women who had this done prior to surgery, a healthy appendix was removed 7 percent of the time, compared with 28 percent of the time when no scan was done."

Diabetics deficient in vitamin D can't process cholesterol normally, so it builds up in their blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. New research has identified a mechanism linking low vitamin D levels to heart disease risk, and may lead to ways to fix the problem, simply by increasing levels of vitamin D.
Vitamin D inhibits the uptake of cholesterol by cells called macrophages. When people are deficient in vitamin D, the macrophage cells absorb more cholesterol, and can't get rid of it. The macrophages get clogged with cholesterol and become what scientists call foam cells, which are one of the earliest markers of atherosclerosis.
Macrophages are dispatched by the immune system in response to inflammation and often are activated by diseases such as diabetes.
Vitamin D Dose Recommendations
Age Dosage
Below 5 35 units per pound per day
Age 5 - 10 2500 units
Age 18 - 30 5000 units
Pregnant Women 5000 units
WARNING: There is no way to know if the above recommendations are correct. The ONLY way to know is to test your blood. You might need 4-5 times the amount recommended above. Ideally your blood level of 25 OH D should be 60ng/ml.
  Heart disease is one of the leading killers in the United States, so making sure you’re getting enough vitamin D is a step nearly everyone should be taking.
Low levels of vitamin D in your blood have long been correlated with higher risk of heart disease and heart attacks, and a previous study found women who take vitamin D supplements lower their risk of death from heart disease by one-third.
It’s also been suggested that the more sunlight you get, the better your cardiovascular health will be, as there are a number of physiological mechanisms triggered by vitamin D production through sunlight exposure that act to fight heart disease, such as:
An increase in your body's natural anti-inflammatory cytokines
The suppression of vascular calcification
The inhibition of vascular smooth muscle growth
Why this is Crucial to Know if You Have Type 2 Diabetes
Just about EVERYONE can benefit from optimizing their vitamin D levels, but if you have type 2 diabetes it is absolutely crucial that you do so.
Nearly 8 percent of the U.S. population, or 24 million people, has diabetes, and another 57 million have pre-diabetes, which puts them at an increased risk of the disease.
So one in five people in the US alone are in the diabetic group and can benefit from this approach.
Heart disease is extremely common in people with diabetes. The American Diabetes Association states that more than 65 percent of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke, and with diabetes, heart attacks occur earlier in life and often result in death.
If you have low vitamin D levels on top of type 2 diabetes, this can nearly double your risk of cardiovascular disease, according to the study in Circulation above. This occurs because diabetics deficient in vitamin D can't process cholesterol normally, so it builds up in your blood vessels, increasing your risk of heart attack and stroke.
Further, vitamin D deficiency is widespread around the world, but in women with type 2 diabetes, the likelihood of low vitamin D levels is about one-third higher than women without diabetes.
So not only do people with diabetes have an increased likelihood of heart disease, they also are more likely to be deficient in vitamin D -- a very slick double-edged sword.
The solution, fortunately, is extremely simple: optimize your vitamin D levels.
Vitamin D Can Boost Your Health All Around
Vitamin D is not “just a vitamin,” but rather the only known substrate for a potent, pleiotropic (meaning it produces multiple effects), repair and maintenance seco-steroid hormone that serves multiple gene-regulatory functions in your body.
There are only 30,000 genes in your body and vitamin D has been shown to influence about 3,000 of them. Receptors that respond to the vitamin have been found in almost every type of human cell, from your brain to your bones. And researchers keep finding health benefits from vitamin D in virtually every area they look.
Can vitamin D help you prevent cancer? You betcha.
Fight colds and the flu? Yes!
Help prevent obesity? It sure can.
Tackle depression, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis? Yes, yes and yes!
In fact, researchers have calculated that simply increasing levels of vitamin D could prevent diseases that claim nearly 1 million lives throughout the world each year, as the widespread vitamin D deficiency seen today is fueling an astonishingly diverse array of common chronic diseases.
Take Action Before it’s Too Late
Do you know what the most common symptom of heart disease is?
Sudden death.
There are absolutely no indications of a problem, no signs like chest pain or shortness of breath. You simply have NO symptoms at all before getting struck by the chest pain that kills you.
There are more than 300,000 deaths EVERY YEAR in the U.S. alone from sudden cardiac death, which is a tragedy made even more upsetting because it is one that does NOT have to happen.
Heart disease, just like type 2 diabetes, is one of the easiest diseases to prevent and avoid, BUT you simply must be proactive.
One of the first steps you should take is to watch my one-hour free lecture on vitamin D, which will tell you what your optimal vitamin D levels should be along with how to safely get them there.
Next, assess your heart disease risk factors. If you have type 2 diabetes, you should know you’re at an increased risk already and simply move ahead to my recommendation below. For the rest of you, one of the most important risk factors will be your HDL to cholesterol ratio.
Keep in mind that your total cholesterol level is just about worthless in determining your risk for heart disease, unless it is close to 300 or higher. And, perhaps more importantly, you need to be aware that cholesterol is not the CAUSE of heart disease. If you become overly concerned with trying to lower your cholesterol level to some set number, you will be completely missing the real problem.
In fact, I have seen a number of people with levels over 250 who actually were at low heart disease risk due to their HDL levels. Conversely, I have seen even more who had cholesterol levels under 200 that were at a very high risk of heart disease based on the following additional tests:
Your HDL/Cholesterol ratio
Your Triglyceride/HDL ratios
HDL percentage is a very potent heart disease risk factor. Just divide your HDL level by your cholesterol. That percentage should ideally be above 24 percent. Below 10 percent, it’s a significant indicator of risk for heart disease.
You can also do the same thing with your triglycerides and HDL ratio. That percentage should be below 2.
What to Do if You’re at Risk
If you are at risk, please do make sure your vitamin D levels are where they need to be, then simply apply the Take Control of Your Health program. This will virtually eliminate your risk -- sometimes quite rapidly-- because it helps to significantly reduce inflammation in your body. And, keeping your inflammation levels low is key if you want to reduce your risk of heart disease.
As a plus, the program will also help you to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes. It’s a win-win situation, and a surprisingly simple way to drastically improve your health."

You made an absolutely HUGE difference. I conducted an interview with Charlie Brown (the leading consumer protection attorney in the United States with respect to mercury) two weeks ago and encouraged you to call and write the FDA, and you did!
Thank you SO much. It nearly brings tears to my eyes to see that we can actually make a difference and start to save children and adults from brain damage by limiting their exposure to this brain poison.
The highest praise came from a highly respected FDA publication, the FDA Webview, edited by Jim Dickinson. The periodical stated that:
“No final rule in FDA’s modern history, or perhaps ever, has attracted this kind of organized opposition.”
Ohio’s largest newspaper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, also ran a major story on our cause, entitled “Dangers of mercury fillings worry some despite federal OK.”
Michael Bender of the Mercury Policy Project, is quoted as saying:
“Clearly, mercury in dental amalgam is a neurotoxin. The FDA's ruling makes no sense, given that the agency cautions pregnant women and children about their exposure to other mercury sources like fish. I don't understand what's changed between last year and this year. Mercury is still a neurotoxin, whether FDA waves a magic wand and says it isn't one or not.”
Many of you are familiar with the travesty of the NutraSweet approval, facilitated by a very similar process by Donald Rumsfeld. Well that was in the late 70s, well before the Internet. I feel that with the same level of response you provided now, we would likely have been able to prevent NutraSweet from ever being approved.
The FDA simply can’t stand up to the light of truth and public exposure, and you did that in a big way. I am so grateful that you would take time out of your busy schedules to do this.
But it’s not over yet, so read on and find out how you can keep the pressure on the FDA. Let’s not let them off the hook this time!
The White House VS the FDA on Mercury Safety
An astute article by Ellen Brown in the Huffington Post shows that the Obama Administration is fighting against each other on mercury: “The Mercury Mischief: As Obama Warns of Hazards, The FDA Approves Mercury Dental Fillings”
To his credit, our President is a staunch opponent of mercury in products; right now his team is negotiating a treaty to phase it out.
Meanwhile, the two people he appointed to run the Food and Drug Administration, Margaret Hamburg and Joshua Sharfstein, wrote a regulation to allow untrammeled sales of mercury amalgam without warnings, and even without disclosure of the mercury.
They quite simply do not want the status quo to change and desire mercury to remain in dentistry and not warn consumers about this fact.
In Washington, they are asking who is running the store – the President, or those whom he appoints and who proceed to ignore him?
What motive would cause an Obama appointee to defy the President of the United States?
Industry Shill at the Wheel
For Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, speculation focused on her close financial ties with dental products colossus Henry Schein Inc., the top distributor of mercury amalgam in the U.S. Hamburg served six years as a director, pulling a salary of a quarter million a year and holding stock worth at least another quarter million, according to the Wall Street Journal.
In a new development, Hamburg has confessed to trading in Schein stock options two months after taking office, up to as late as two weeks before the rule was announced, and contacting Henry Schein Inc. to unload more of her options as late as the day before the rule was announced.
Her defense in light of this obvious and massive conflict of interest is that her profits were small.
Seeking to stop this stormy swirl of slime, Charlie Brown of Consumers for Dental Choice filed a complaint with the U.S. Inspector General.
The second burning question was whether or not Hamburg had recused herself from the rule, and if so, when?
Again, the grassroots movement you were part of succeeded in getting at the truth.
In an email to Charlie Brown, Jim Dickinson of FDA Webview writes:
“Press Office told me today there is no recusal date because she didn’t file a document about it. It is not required. She simply did not participate, which is the same thing as a recusal, I was told. Basically, they’re saying recusals don’t have to be in writing or filed formally with anyone.”
So, it turns out Hamburg never officially recused herself from the mercury rule, despite holding and trading stock options in the nation’s number one seller of mercury fillings, Henry Schein Inc.
One grassroots supporter, Marilynn Block of Portland, Ore., wrote these Haikus and emailed them to Hamburg in response to the latest findings:

Don’t Let Up the Pressure – Tell Deputy Commissioner Sharfstein to Reconsider!
Grassroots effort succeeded in stopping Hamburg’s stonewalling, but it’s not over yet.
Armed with this latest information, Brown is apprising the Inspector General and appropriate Members of
Congress of the latest round of chicanery at FDA.
Here’s how you can help to keep the momentum going.
So far, Deputy Commissioner Sharfstein’s role has been very vague and unclear. It’s still not known if he was acting on Commissioner Hamburg’s behalf all along, or if he simply received the file once it was too late to object.
Jim Turner, a great public interest lawyer in Washington DC, has filed a petition for reconsideration on behalf of Citizens for Health and other organizations and individuals.

This petition gives Deputy Commissioner Sharfstein another chance -- a chance to choose between children and Henry Schein Inc.; a chance to choose between his boss and the President who appointed him.
I urge you to call or write FDA Deputy Commissioner Joshua Sharfstein and ask him to reconsider this rule. Ask him to return to being a child advocate, which he was before he came to FDA.
So please call Commissioner Sharfstein, at 301.796-5040, or write him at JMSharf1@fda.hhs.gov
You can also add even more pressure by calling your Congressman; your federal legislative representative.
If you don’t know who your Congressman or Congresswoman is, you can find out by going to www.congress.org. You can also call Capitol Hill and ask who your Congressman is, at 202.224-43121, or 202.225-3121.
It's important to make it clear that people at the grassroots are not going to accept the FDA's ruling, which protects the profits of the seller of amalgam instead of protecting our children from a know neurotoxin.
Join Those Who are Watching Out for Your Health
Hopefully you will get a chance to review my two video interviews with Charlie Brown, who is the leading consumer protection attorney in the United States with respect to mercury. He is the stealth behind-the-scenes champion for consumer protection.
If you missed the first interview, please take a moment to watch it now.
Most Americans are absolutely unaware of what he and his organization have tirelessly been doing for the last ten years by seeking to eliminate the use of mercury in dentistry in the U.S.

If you feel half as strongly as I do about the use of mercury in dentistry, I strongly encourage you to watch all of the videos above so you can understand the problem and, more importantly, actively participate in the process to eliminate mercury in dentistry in the U.S.
In addition, please help grow this important grassroots movement by becoming a Facebook Fan. The project is run by Patrick Sullivan Jr., president of Jigsaw Health, based in Phoenix. Patrick is also a board member of Consumers for Dental Choice.

"159","https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/09/10/why-you-should-avoid-red-rice-yeast.aspx","September 10, 2009","Why You Should Avoid Red Yeast Rice","By Dr. Mercola
Red yeast rice, a mainstay of Chinese medicine since ancient times, is emerging in drug stores and vitamin shops as a natural tool to lower cholesterol.
The substance is actually derived from a fungus that grows on rice and is eaten as a dietary staple in certain Asian countries.
As its popularity grows, I wanted to share some important information, and a warning of sorts, about red yeast rice.
Even though it is natural, red yeast rice is not a panacea or miracle cure for those of you looking to lower your cholesterol. In fact, using it is an approach I would recommend avoiding.
What’s All the Hype about Red Yeast Rice?
Red yeast rice is sold over-the-counter and is often promoted as an alternative to cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, especially for those who stop taking the drugs due to side effects, like unbearable muscle pain.
In one recent study, researchers studied 62 people with high cholesterol, half of whom were given red yeast rice twice a day for six months while the other half received a placebo. The people taking red yeast rice also had weekly meetings for three months during which they learned about how to incorporate healthy nutrition, exercise and stress management into their lives.
After six months, the researchers found[1]:
LDL (bad) cholesterol levels decreased by an average of 35 mg/dL in those taking red yeast rice, compared with 15 mg/dL in the placebo group
Total cholesterol levels improved more in the red yeast rice group than the placebo group
Although the researchers acknowledged that the study was small and of short duration, they concluded that red yeast rice, coupled with lifestyle changes, could decrease LDL cholesterol without increasing pain levels or liver or muscle enzyme levels (as often happens in people taking statin drugs). They recommended the red yeast rice as a valid treatment option for people who cannot tolerate statin drugs.
A separate study, this one of 5,000 people who have suffered a heart attack, also found favorable results. Those who took an extract of red yeast rice for five years reduced their risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 percent. It also lowered their chances of having a heart procedure such as bypass surgery or angioplasty, and even appeared to reduce their risk of cancer by as much as two-thirds.[2]
So why, then, do I NOT recommend you take this ""natural"" supplement if you have high cholesterol?
The answer is two-fold and may surprise you:
Red yeast rice is a statin drug -- with all the same side effects
Cholesterol is not your enemy
Red Yeast Rice is a Statin Drug
The ""active"" compounds in red yeast rice are known as monacolins, and are substances known to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. One type of monacolin, ""monacolin K,"" is also known as mevinolin or lovastatin.[3]
Lovastatin, as you might now recognize, is the first statin drug to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and it goes by the brand names of Mevacor and Altocor. So if you’re taking red yeast rice in the hopes of avoiding a statin drug -- surprise!
They’re essentially the same drug.
And if you are concerned about your cholesterol levels, taking a drug, even a ""natural"" drug like red yeast rice, should be your absolute last resort. And when I say last resort, I’m saying the odds are very high, greater than 1000 to 1, that you don’t need drugs to lower your cholesterol.
To put it another way, among the more than 20,000 patients who have come to my clinic, only four or five of them truly needed these drugs, as they had genetic challenges that required it.
Why Statin Drugs -- Including Red Yeast Rice -- Should be Avoided
Count yourself lucky that you probably do NOT need to take cholesterol-lowering medications of any kind, because these are some nasty little pills.
Statin drugs work by inhibiting an enzyme in your liver that’s needed to manufacture cholesterol. What is so concerning about this is that when you go tinkering around with the delicate workings of your body, you risk throwing everything off kilter.
For starters, statin drugs deplete your body of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which is beneficial to heart health and muscle function.

CoQ10 is a cofactor (co-enzyme) that is essential for a system of enzymes that create ATP molecules, which are needed for cellular energy production.
Organs, such as your heart, which have higher energy requirements therefore also need more CoQ10 to function properly.
Statins deplete your body of CoQ10, which can have devastating results. And because doctors rarely inform people of this risk and advise them to take a CoQ10 supplement, as your body gets more and more depleted, it can lead to fatigue, followed by muscle weakness and soreness, and eventually heart failure.
Congestive heart failure is in fact a very common health risk of statin drugs, and a major reason to avoid them.
Muscle pain and weakness, a condition called rhabdomyolysis, is the most common side effect of statin drugs, which is thought to occur because statins activate the gene atrogin-1 gene, which plays a key role in muscle atrophy.[4]
It’s important to remember that your heart is also a major muscle and can be affected in the same manner as the other muscles in your body.
By the way, muscle pain and weakness may be an indication that your body tissues are actually breaking down -- a condition that can cause kidney damage.
Statin drugs have also been linked to:
An increased risk of polyneuropathy (nerve damage that causes pain in the hands and feet and trouble walking)
Dizziness
Cognitive impairment, including memory loss[5]
A potential increased risk of cancer[6]
Decreased function of your immune system[7]
Depression
Liver problems, including a potential increase in liver enzymes (so people taking statins must be regularly monitored for normal liver function)
And a possible association was even found between statins and an increased risk of Lou Gehrig's disease.[8]
Exposing yourself to these potentially serious risks by taking statin drugs becomes even more unacceptable when you understand the truth about cholesterol -- that it is actually your friend, not your enemy.
Why You Need Cholesterol
In the United States, the idea that cholesterol is evil is very much ingrained in most people’s minds. But this is a very harmful myth that needs to be put to rest right now.
Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance found not only in your bloodstream but also in every cell in your body, where it helps to produce cell membranes, hormones, vitamin D and bile acids that help you to digest fat. Cholesterol also helps in the formation of memories and is vital for your neurological function.
As Ron Rosedale, MD, who is widely considered to be the leading anti-aging doctor in the United States, points out[9]:
""First and foremost, cholesterol is a vital component of every cell membrane on Earth. In other words, there is no life on Earth that can live without cholesterol. That will automatically tell you that, in of itself, it cannot be evil. In fact it is one of our best friends.
We would not be here without it. No wonder lowering cholesterol too much increases one's risk of dying. Cholesterol also is a precursor to all of the steroid hormones. You cannot make estrogen, testosterone, cortisone, and a host of other vital hormones without cholesterol.""
Other ""evidence"" that cholesterol is good for you?
Consider the role of ""good"" HDL cholesterol. Essentially, HDL takes cholesterol from your body’s tissues and arteries, and brings it back to your liver, where most of your cholesterol is produced. If the purpose of this was to eliminate cholesterol from your body, it would make sense that the cholesterol would be shuttled back to your kidneys or intestines so your body could remove it.
Instead, it goes back to your liver.
Why?
Because your liver is going to reuse it.
""It is taking it back to your liver so that your liver can recycle it; put it back into other particles to be taken to tissues and cells that need it,"" Dr. Rosedale says. ""Your body is trying to make and conserve the cholesterol for the precise reason that it is so important, indeed vital, for health.""
Do You Really Have ""High"" Cholesterol?
Sally Fallon, the president of the Weston A. Price Foundation, and Mary Enig, Ph.D, an expert in lipid biochemistry, have gone so far as to call high cholesterol ""an invented disease, a ‘problem’ that emerged when health professionals learned how to measure cholesterol levels in the blood.""[10]
And this explanation is spot on.
If you have increased levels of cholesterol, it is at least in part because of increased inflammation in your body. The cholesterol is there to do a job: help your body heal and repair.
Conventional medicine misses the boat entirely when they recommend that lowering cholesterol is the way to reduce your risk of heart attacks, because what is actually needed is to address whatever is causing your body damage -- and leading to increased inflammation and then increased cholesterol.
Further, there is absolutely NO evidence to show that lowering your LDL cholesterol to 100 or below is good for you, but what do you think the American Heart Association STILL recommends?
Lowering your LDL cholesterol levels to less than 100.[11]
And to make matters worse, the standard recommendation to get to that level almost always includes cholesterol-lowering drugs.
The Risks of Lowering Your Cholesterol Too Much
The common mindset in much of the developed world is that lowering your total blood cholesterol below 200 mg/dL is a key to good heart health. In reality, lowering your cholesterol does nothing to address any underlying problems … and lowering it too much can seriously devastate your health.
One large study conduced by Dutch researchers found that men with chronically low cholesterol levels showed a consistently higher risk of having depressive symptoms.[12] This may be because cholesterol affects the metabolism of serotonin, a substance involved in the regulation of your mood.
On a similar note, Canadian researchers found that those in the lowest quarter of total cholesterol concentration had more than six times the risk of committing suicide as did those in the highest quarter.[13]
Dozens of studies also support a connection between low or lowered cholesterol levels and violent behavior, through this same pathway: lowered cholesterol levels may lead to lowered brain serotonin activity, which may, in turn, lead to increased violence and aggression.[14]
And one meta-analysis of over 41,000 patient records found that people who take statin drugs to lower their cholesterol as much as possible may have a higher risk of cancer,[15] while other studies have linked low cholesterol to Parkinson’s disease.
What cholesterol level is too low?
Brace yourself.
Probably any level much under 150, an optimum would be more like 200.
So how do you know if your cholesterol really is too high?
How to Find Out What Your Cholesterol Levels Really Mean
Personally, I believe anything above 330 is likely too high. But another powerful way to determine if you’re at risk from abnormal cholesterol metabolism is to check your ratio of HDL, or ""good"" cholesterol, and your total cholesterol.
Your HDL percentage is a very potent heart disease risk factor.
Simply divide your HDL level by your cholesterol. That percentage should ideally be above 25 percent. Typically, the higher the better, as there are no known side effects of having too high good cholesterol.
If your ratio falls below 15-20 percent you are at high risk, and below 10 percent, it’s a significant indicator of risk for heart disease.
You can also do the same thing with your triglycerides and HDL ratio. That percentage should be below 2.
Keep in mind, however, that these are still simply guidelines, and there’s a lot more that goes into your risk of heart disease than any one of these numbers.
Do You Want to Safely and Effectively Optimize Your Cholesterol Levels?
First, please realize that simply lowering your dietary cholesterol intake is not an effective primary strategy.
Why?
Because 75 percent of your cholesterol is produced by your liver, which is influenced by your insulin levels. Therefore, if you optimize your insulin levels, you will also regulate your cholesterol levels.
One of the most powerful ways you can do that is by exercising, and paying attention to the foods you eat. Foods that increase your insulin levels will also contribute to high cholesterol by making your liver produce more of it.
With that in mind, here are my primary recommendations for safely regulating your cholesterol levels:
Get the right amount of exercise. When you exercise you increase your circulation and the blood flow throughout your body. The components of your immune system are also better circulated, which means your immune system has a better chance of fighting an illness before it has the opportunity to spread.
Make sure you’re getting plenty of high-quality, animal-based omega3-fats, such as those from krill oil.
Reduce, with the plan of eliminating, grains and sugars in your daily diet.
Eat the right foods for your nutritional type.
Eat a good portion of your food raw.
Eat healthy, preferably raw, fats that correspond to your nutritional type. This includes:
Olive oil
Coconut and coconut oil
Organic raw dairy products (including butter, cream, sour cream, cheese, etc.)
Avocados
Raw nuts
Seeds
Eggs (lightly cooked with yolks intact or raw)
Organic, grass-fed meats
Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol excessively.
Address your emotional challenges. I particularly love Meridian Tapping Techniques (MTT) for stress management.
As you’ll notice, these recommendations are all lifestyle-based, meaning that with a few key changes to your diet, activity level and emotional health your cholesterol levels will naturally optimize -- without the need for statin drugs or supplements like red yeast rice.

For example, nutrigenomics can explain why eating rancid or oxidized omega-fats and refined sugar encourages inflammation and cancer growth.
It is important to understand that a diet rich in omega-3 fats can reduce inflammation in cancer. So can healthy omega-6 fats like gamma linoleic acid (GLA), found in evening primrose, black currant seed, and borage oil. GLA inhibits the action of the cancer gene HER-2/neu, which is overexpressed in 30 percent of all breast cancers, making them particularly lethal.
According to Donnie Yance, clinical master herbalist and certified nutritionist, chronic conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular disease have a strong link with chronic inflammation, which promotes the production of free radicals.
The transcription protein Nuclear Factor-kappa Beta (NfKB) is a major inducer of inflammation. In cancer, a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) is the likely driver that activates NfKB.
Some plant-based phytocompounds can enhance PTEN expression or inhibit PTEN mutation, including quercetin, resveratrol, and various isoflavones often referred to as phytoestrogens. An ever-growing body of evidence suggests that the use of these compounds can and should play an important role in cancer prevention and treatment.
NfKB modulation is an important target for cancer prevention and treatment. NfKB can be modulated by:
The curcumin in tumeric
Stilbenes such as the resveratrol found in grape skins
The proathocyanidins in grape seeds
Catechins such as EGCG, which is present in green tea.
The ursolic acid in holy basil, also called Tulsi (Holy Basil) , and rosemary
NfKB can also be modulated by a number of other plant-based compounds. For more information, please read Donald Yance's full paper linked below.

The letter from the Health Protection Agency, the official body that oversees public health, was leaked to The Daily Mail, leading to demands to know why the information has not been given to the public before the vaccination of millions of people, including children, begins.
It tells the neurologists that they must be alert for an increase in a brain disorder called Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), which could be triggered by the vaccine. GBS attacks the lining of the nerves, causing paralysis and inability to breathe, and can be fatal.
The letter refers to the use of a similar swine flu vaccine in the United States in 1976 when:
More people died from the vaccination than from swine flu
The vaccine may have increased the risk of contracting GBS by eight times
The vaccine was withdrawn after just ten weeks when the link with GBS became clear
The U.S. Government was forced to pay out millions of dollars to those affected
Concerns have already been raised that the new vaccine has not been sufficiently tested and that the effects, especially on children, are unknown.
Vitamin D Dose Recommendations
Age Dosage
Below 5 35 units per pound per day
Age 5 - 10 2500 units
Age 18 - 30 5000 units
Pregnant Women 5000 units
WARNING: There is no way to know if the above recommendations are correct. The ONLY way to know is to test your blood. You might need 4-5 times the amount recommended above. Ideally your blood level of 25 OH D should be 60ng/ml.
  As mentioned in this article, the 1976 swine flu vaccine campaign caused more harm than good, and there are indications that the current campaign may end up being a devastating repeat or worse.
At that time, one person died from the actual swine flu, while 25 people died from adverse reactions to the vaccine, and several hundred people developed crippling Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
According to The Daily Mail, the British Health Protection Agency sent letters to 600 neurologists on July 29th, warning them to be on the lookout for cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome once the swine flu vaccine campaign begins.
Why the warning was not sent out to general practitioners, who will be administering the shot, seems an odd choice if public safety is indeed the main concern.
This confidential correspondence between the British public health agency and neurologists in the U.K. is the first clue that all is probably not well with this fast-tracked pandemic vaccine.
Are You Willing to Let Them Experiment on Your Child?
According to a recent report from CNN, the U.S. is set to receive as many as 600 million doses of swine flu vaccine, enough for 300 million Americans.
Based on the recommendations from the World Health Organization's (WHO) advisory group on immunization matters, the top priority groups that stand to receive the vaccine first include:
Pregnant women
Children over the age of 6 months with chronic health conditions
Adults with chronic health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease, asthma, or obesity
Health care workers
However, pregnant women, children, and those whose immune systems are already compromised are also at even greater risk to suffer severe side effects from the vaccine, as the adjuvants in the vaccine are designed to reduce your immune function.
Barbara Loe Fisher of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) recently warned about the campaign underway to turn schools into virtual vaccination clinics. In many U.S. states, school has already started, so the decision of whether or not to vaccinate your child may become an issue you'll have to deal with in the coming weeks.
Swine Flu Drug of Choice Causes Side Effects in Half of All Children
In the U.K. the hysteria over swine flu led to flu drugs being offered online, without a doctor's prescription. This is incomprehensible, considering their risk. Just a couple of weeks ago I reported on brand new study findings that the swine flu drug of choice, Tamiflu, caused one or more side effects in OVER HALF of all children who received it!
Side effects included:
Nausea – 29 percent
Stomach pain or cramps – 20 percent
Neuropsychiatric side effects including inability to think clearly, nightmares, and ""strange behavior"" – nearly 20 percent
Sleep problems – 12 percent
The British Medical Association's lead expert on swine flu went on the record stating that Tamiflu is now being overused.
Keep in mind that, although the swine flu has spread across the world it appears to have decreased in severity. The vast majority of cases are very mild, requiring only a few days in bed.
In fact, the regular seasonal flu is still far worse, and more deadly, than the swine flu.
How Vaccines Can Cause so Much Harm
The intended effect of a vaccination is to help you build immunity to a potentially harmful organism. However, your body's immune system is already designed to do this in response to organisms that invade your body naturally.
Most disease-causing organisms enter your body through the mucous membranes of your nose, mouth, pulmonary system or your digestive tract. These mucous membranes have their own immune system, called the IgA immune system, which fights off invading organisms at the point of entry, reducing or even eliminating the need for activation of your body's immune system.
A vaccination, however, delivers either live or attenuated (dead) viruses directly into your tissues and blood stream through injection, completely bypassing your body's first line of defense. And when combined with an immune adjuvant, your body's immune system kicks into high gear in response to the vaccination. If your immune system is too weak to deal with the assault, severe side effects can occur.
Injecting organisms into your body to provoke immunity is contrary to nature, and vaccination carries enormous potential to do serious damage to your health.
To emphasize this point further, when ingested, the vaccine adjuvant squalene is actually recognized by your immune system as an oil molecule native to your body. It has antioxidant properties and is found throughout your nervous system and brain.
The difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" squalene is the route by which it enters your body. Injection is an abnormal route of entry which incites your immune system to attack all the squalene in your body, not just the vaccine adjuvant.
As a result, your immune system will attempt to destroy the molecule wherever it finds it, including in places where it occurs naturally, and where it is vital to the health of your nervous system.
For more information about squalene, and the hazards it poses when included in flu shots, please review my recent special report on the topic, if you have not already done so.
Squalene Update as of October 2009:
According to Barbara Loe Fisher, founder of the NVIC, none of the H1N1 vaccines being distributed in the United States contain squalene or other oil in water adjuvants.
 
We successfully made enough fuss about the potential danger of fast tracking licensure of squalene adjuvants into US H1N1 vaccines under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that can be invoked during a declared public health emergency that the FDA has NOT licensed these adjuvants for the U.S.

There is squalene in H1N1 vaccines licensed in Europe but not yet in the U.S. That is not to say the vaccine manufacturers will not try to get the adjuvants inserted into vaccines in the future, but for now we have won on this point.
In the Meantime Consider Vitamin D as it Helps Prevent Seasonal Flu
Just last week I reported on Canada's decision to investigate the role of vitamin D in protection against the swine flu. This is great, but there are already overwhelming evidence showing that your vitamin D levels play a significant role in your likelihood of getting the flu.
Vitamin D has been a hot research topic these past few years, and has been shown to have remarkable impact on nearly every single disease studied.
Here is a list of four studies published this year, showing an inverse association between respiratory tract infections and 25(OH)D levels. That is, the higher your vitamin D level, the lower your risk of contracting colds, flu, and other respiratory tract infections:
A 2007 study suggests higher vitamin D status enhances your immunity to microbial infections. They found that subjects with vitamin D deficiency had significantly more days of absence from work due to respiratory infection than did control subjects.
A 2009 study on vitamin D deficiency in newborns with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) confirmed a strong, positive correlation between newborns' and mother's vitamin D levels. Over 87 percent of all newborns and over 67 percent of all mothers had vitamin D levels lower than 20 ng/ml, which is a severe deficiency state.
Newborns with vitamin D deficiency appear to have an increased risk of developing ALRI, and since the child's vitamin D level strongly correlates with its mother's, the researchers recommend that all mothers' optimize their vitamin D levels during pregnancy, especially in the winter months, to safeguard their baby's health.
A 2009 analysis of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey examined the association between vitamin D levels and recent upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in nearly 19,000 subjects over the age of 12.
Recent URTI was reported by:
17 percent of participants with vitamin D levels of 30 ng/ml or higher
20 percent of participants with vitamin D levels between 10-30 ng/ml.
24 percent of participants with vitamin D levels below 10 ng/ml
The positive correlation between lower vitamin D levels and increased risk of URTI was even stronger in individuals with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Another 2009 report in the journal Pediatric Research stated that infants and children appear more susceptible to viral rather than bacterial infections when deficient in vitamin D. And that, based on the available evidence showing a strong connection between vitamin D, infections, and immune function in children, vitamin D supplementation may be a valuable therapy in pediatric medicine.
Ultimately, your best bet is to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D around 60 ng/ml year-round. Please note that this is far higher than most doctors will refer to as ""normal."" Rather it is the optimal level you'll want to maintain for disease prevention.
I strongly recommend you watch my one-hour free vitamin D lecture along with my video on vitamin D's role in flu prevention for more in-depth information about vitamin D's role in flu prevention.
Taking care of your health to reduce or eliminate your risk of contracting the flu is always going to be your safest bet. In addition to optimizing your vitamin D levels, this past article details my other recommendations for avoiding the flu naturally, and I strongly urge you to start incorporating these changes into your life today.
Educate Yourself Further
This video was originally aired on August 12, 2009, featuring CBS News Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton and NVIC's Barbara Loe Fisher. Here they discuss the possible dangers of the swine flu versus the H1N1 vaccine. Both provide sensible information and guidelines on this issue. I can't stress enough how important it is for this type of information to make it into the conventional media."

Perhaps More Than You Think!","Vitamin D deficiency is quite common, and a growing list of diseases and conditions are being linked with it. Regular sun exposure, without sunscreen, causes your skin to produce vitamin D naturally. But how much sun do you need?
You've probably seen some vague guidelines, recommending ""a few minutes every day."" But these recommendations are far too general to be useful. The amount of sun you need to meet your vitamin D requirements varies hugely, depending on your location, your skin type, the time of year, the time of day, and even the atmospheric conditions.
The Vitamin D/UV Calculator
Scientists at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research have devised a calculator that will take all those factors into consideration and estimate how many minutes of exposure you need for your skin to produce 25 mcg (the equivalent of 1,000 International Units) of vitamin D.
It's not the most user-friendly interface and it is very easy to enter the wrong information. But once you get past the technicalities, it's very interesting to see how much the answers change when you vary the input.
It is also not written for US cities so you can go to this page to find out latitude and longitude of many cites and enter the numbers manually. The easiest way may be to simply google ""altitude of [your town]"". Remember to convert it to kilometers. One kilometer is about 3300 feet.
If your latitude is 39 S, enter -39. If your longitude is 76 W, enter -76.
You'll also need to enter the time of day you are going out in the sun, expressed as UTC (Greenwich Mean Time). Here is a converter that will convert local time into UTC. The calculator uses a 24 hour clock, so hours from 1 PM to midnight are expressed as 13 to 24.
The calculator also wants to know the thickness of the ozone layer. I suggest just setting this one to medium.
Be sure to click the radio button next to the entries. They are often not automatically selected when you fill in the values.
Keep in mind that the exposure times given are considered enough to maintain healthy vitamin D status. If you are starting out with a vitamin D deficiency, you might need more.
Vitamin D Dose Recommendations
Age Dosage
Below 5 35 units per pound per day
Age 5 - 10 2500 units
Adults
5000 units
Pregnant Women 5000 units
WARNING: There is no way to know if the above recommendations are correct. The ONLY way to know is to test your blood. You might need 4-5 times the amount recommended above. Ideally your blood level of 25 OH D should be 60ng/ml.
  As mentioned in the article above, figuring out how long to stay in the sun in order to produce sufficient amounts of vitamin D can be tricky business, although as a general rule of thumb, you'd want to expose as much of your body as possible to sunlight until your skin turns the lightest shade of pink.
However, the calculator created by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research could be helpful as well, especially if you have darker skin. But I would still only use it to get a general guideline.
It's important to remember that you need to get your vitamin D levels measured regularly, regardless of what method you use to raise or maintain your vitamin D levels. That way, if you find that sun exposure is not enough to maintain an optimal level, you may want to look into taking a supplement, for example.
Without testing, you will not be able to figure out how much you need, or whether the sun exposure you get, or the supplements you take, is sufficient.
For more information on recommended dosages for children and adults, please see this previous article. You can find information about testing and optimal vitamin D levels at this link.
Later on, I'll review several of the factors that influence how much vitamin D your body can produce when you're in the sun, but first, I want to bring up another important, related finding.
Preterm Births are on the Rise World-Wide
According to a recent report by CNN, nearly 10 percent of all annual worldwide births are born prematurely (before 37 weeks of development), and the trend is rising across the world. A report by the March of Dimes states that one million of these preemies die within the first month of life, each year.
In the US, the rate of preterm births has increased by 36 percent in the past 25 years, and the annual health care costs for preterm care and associated health problems is now over $26 billion.
Africa has the highest premature birth rate, where 11.9 percent of births each year are preterm. Surprisingly, North America (consisting of the US and Canada) come in second place, with a preterm birth rate of 10.6 percent of all births.
Preterm Births Can be Drastically Reduced by Optimizing Vitamin D Levels
Just days after CNN's article was published, the Times Online reported there is powerful new evidence supporting the claim that sufficient vitamin D levels can reduce your risk of having a premature delivery. It can also help protect your newborn baby from other health problems.
In what is considered the first scientific trial that meets the most stringent criteria for ""evidence-based inquiry,"" US researchers Drs. Hollis and Wagner divulged their findings at a recent international vitamin D research conference in Brugge, Belgium.
Their findings included:
Mothers who took 4,000 IU's (ten times the RDA of 400 IU) of vitamin D during pregnancy had their risk of premature birth reduced by half
Premature babies born to women taking high doses of vitamin D were reduced by half at both 32 and 37 weeks, and
There were also fewer babies who were born ""small for dates""
Women taking high doses of vitamin D had a 25 per cent reduction in infections, particularly respiratory infections such as colds and flu as well as fewer infections of the vagina and the gums
The ""core morbidities of pregnancy"" were reduced by 30 per cent in the women who took the high-dose vitamin D. (Including diabetes, high blood pressure, and pre-eclampsia – a potentially deadly increase in blood pressure and fluid)
Babies getting the highest amounts of vitamin D after birth had fewer colds and less eczema
Another 2009 study on vitamin D deficiency in newborns with acute lower respiratory infection confirmed a strong, positive correlation between newborns' and mothers' vitamin D levels.
That study found that over 87 percent of all newborns and over 67 percent of all mothers had vitamin D levels lower than 20 ng/ml, which is a severe deficiency state. As a result, the researchers recommended that all mothers optimize their vitamin D levels during pregnancy, especially in the winter months, to safeguard their babies' health.
In addition, numerous other studies have found that vitamin D may protect against a number of birth defects.
Researcher Dr. Bruce Hollis of the Medical University of South Carolina also said:
""I'm telling every pregnant mother I see to take 4,000 IUs and every nursing mother to take 6,400 IUs of vitamin D a day.
I think it is medical malpractice for obstetricians not to know what the vitamin D level of their patients is. This study will put them on notice.""
Along with Dr. Carol Wagner, the pair has researched vitamin D's impact on pregnancy outcomes for a number of years. In 2006 they published a study in the journal CMAJ, ""Nutritional vitamin D status during pregnancy: reasons for concern, "" and in a 2007 study they discovered that that vitamin D deficiency is quite common in pregnancy.
Naturally, pregnancy is not the only time you need to be mindful of your vitamin D status. Most people, including children, adolescents and seniors, are in fact deficient.
As I've stated on many occasions, getting your vitamin D from the sun (or a safe tanning bed) is the absolute best way to optimize your vitamin D level, but there are a number of factors that influence your vitamin D production that you need to take into account, and below I will explain why.
Factors That Influence Production of Vitamin D in Your Skin
Production of previtamin D3 in your skin is highly individual and varies depending on several factors, including:
Skin color, and current tan level
Amount of time spent in the sun
Weather conditions such as: cloud cover and pollution, ozone layer, surface reflection
Latitude and altitude (elevation)
Season
Time of day
Use of sunscreen
Clothing
So, let's review these factors to see how they affect your production of vitamin D when you're trying to metabolize it naturally, from the sun, as opposed to getting it from an oral vitamin D supplement.
Skin Color, Current Tan Level, and Amount of Time Spent in the Sun
Caucasians and others with paler skin will hit an ""equilibrium point"" after about 20 minutes of exposure to UVB light, at which point vitamin D will no longer be produced.
You can tell you've reached your optimal exposure for the day when your skin turns a very light shade of pink. After that you're only increasing your chances of getting burned, which is something you definitely want to avoid. There is NO additional benefit to staying in the sun any longer. You only risk damage by extending your time in the sun.
It's not like your gas tank. Your body can only produce a limited amount of vitamin D every day. Once it reaches its limit you only cause damage by going beyond that amount. However, once you have a tan you spend much longer in the sun.
If you have darker skin, reaching this equilibrium point can take two to six times longer (or up to an hour or two), depending on your pigmentation.
A light-skinned person fairly far from the equator (such as in the UK or the northern U.S.) needs at least three of these 20 minute sessions per week, in bright midday sunlight and with few clothes.
A dark-skinned person, of course, should be outside significantly longer, and more often, to get the same effect.
Weather Conditions
The more clouds there are, the less UV radiation reaches the earth's surface. However, UV can penetrate cloud cover to some extent, so it is still possible to get sunburned on a cloudy day. This is especially true under light clouds, which can block infrared radiation but not UV radiation, leaving the day deceptively cool.
Likewise, some types of ground cover reflect UV radiation, increasing its intensity even in deceptively shaded areas. These surfaces include sand, snow, and water.
Air pollution, on the other hand, can block UV radiation too effectively. If the air pollution contains large amounts of ozone, UV penetration can be reduced to a sometimes dangerously low level for at-risk populations. This can be particularly true of cities surrounded by hills or mountains, which trap air pollution.
Latitude and Altitude
Sunlight is, of course, strongest at the equator, where the sunlight comes from directly overhead rather than at an angle; the solar radiation therefore has the shortest distance to travel through the earth's atmosphere. The UV radiation is about four times as strong at the equator as it is at the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
To find the latitude of your town or city, check out this easy-to-use International Latitude / Longitude finder to determine how your latitude affects your sun exposure:
Between 0 and 10 degrees latitude, there is very intense sunlight for several hours before and after noon, year-round. Pale or untanned skin will be completely overwhelmed in just a few minutes.
Between 10 and 30 degrees latitude, there are several hours of very strong sunlight each day, especially during the summer, but the hours after dawn and before dusk can be milder.
Between 30 and 50 degrees latitude, sunlight can be strong during the summer, but a tan can be built up gradually by starting in the milder spring.
Upwards of 50 degrees latitude, summers are often short. However, the inhabitants of these countries often have pale skin that should still be exposed to summer sunlight with care. Anyone with very dark skin living at these latitudes is at a very high risk of vitamin D deficiency.
UV radiation is also more intense at higher altitudes, because there is less atmosphere to absorb it. The radiation increases by about 10 percent for every additional mile above sea level. You will therefore burn more easily when you're at high altitudes -- a fact that is often difficult to remember because it is usually colder at higher altitudes.
Season
Always start ""priming"" your skin early in the spring when the sun's rays are still mild. In summer, avoiding being outside when the solar radiation is most intense is a good idea at most latitudes, to avoid sunburn.
In many parts of the world it is even possible—and probably advisable—to sunbathe at noon in the winter with as little clothing as the weather permits (finding a place that is out of the wind can reduce the cold significantly). This is the time of year when you need to be most concerned about the amount of vitamin D you are receiving, as your vitamin D levels can drop by up to 50 percent during winter months.
Time of Day
The optimal time to be in the sun for vitamin D production is as near to solar noon as possible. That would be between roughly 10:00 am and 2:00 pm.

During this time you need the shortest exposure time to produce vitamin D because UVB rays are most intense at this time. Plus, when the sun goes down toward the horizon, the UVB is filtered out much more than the dangerous UVA.

This information is just beginning to permeate through the mainstream media, so let me repeat and emphasize this important point …

If you want to get out in the sun to maximize your vitamin D production, and minimize your risk of malignant melanoma, the middle of the day is the best and safest time to go.
You just need to be very careful about the length of your exposure. Remember you only need enough exposure to have your skin turn the lightest shade of pink. This may only be a few minutes for some.

Once you reach this point your body will not make any additional vitamin D and any additional exposure will only cause harm and damage to your skin.
Use of Sunscreen and Clothing
Keep in mind that using sunscreen while outdoors in large part nullifies your efforts to metabolize adequate amounts of vitamin D. I recommend testing your vitamin D levels to make sure you're not deficient before resorting to sunscreen of any kind.
But, if you really need some form of sun protection because you're outside for extended periods of time, either use light clothing to cover exposed areas, or look for safer, natural sunscreen products that contain no petrochemicals, which you can likely find in your local health food store.
Another excellent resource is the EWG's ""Skin Deep Report,"" where you can find out which brands of sunscreens are free from toxic chemicals.
Bathing
It is important to remember, if you are using the sun or a safe tanning bed to obtain your vitamin D, that the vitamin D takes about 48 hours to be completely absorbed into your blood stream, and you can easily wash it off with soap and water.
So you might want to consider only using soap in your armpits and groin for at least 48 hours to allow all the vitamin D to be absorbed. Personally I never use soap on my body other than these places (and my hands of course). Seems a waste to remove the sebum which is a collection of fatty acids on the skin. Over-washing can impair one of primary methods of staying healthy.
Not washing my skin hasn't ever seemed to harm it and many people comment that my skin is as soft as young child's. I think that also has to do with keeping fat content optimized by avoiding processed fats and having high quality omega-6 and 3 fats."

The CDC goes on to say, and I quote:
""So far, most flu is 2009 H1N1 flu (sometimes called ""swine flu"").""
But wait stop the presses.
A three-month-long investigation by CBS News, released earlier this week that  included state-by-state test results, revealed some very different facts. The CBS study found that H1N1 flu cases are NOT as prevalent as feared. A CBS article even states:
""If you've been diagnosed ""probable"" or ""presumed"" 2009 H1N1 or ""swine flu"" in recent months, you may be surprised to know this: odds are you didn't have H1N1 flu. In fact, you probably didn't have flu at all.""
Obviously CBS News and the CDC are completely contradicting each other. So who is right?
Well, CBS reports that in late July 2009 the CDC advised states to STOP testing for H1N1 flu, and they also stopped counting individual cases.
Their rationale for this, according to CBS News, was that it was a waste of resources to test for H1N1 flu because it was already confirmed as an epidemic.
So just like that virtually every person who visited their physician with flu-like symptoms since late July was assumed to have H1N1, with no testing necessary because, after all, there's an epidemic.
It's interesting to note that at the same time as the CDC decided the H1N1 epidemic warranted no further testing for cases due to its epidemic status, Finnish health authorities actually downgraded the threat of swine flu.
In late July the health ministry and the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) in Finland actually removed swine flu from a list of diseases considered dangerous to the public because the majority of cases recovered without medication or hospital care!
And, as the CDC continues to use fear to motivate and control Americans with their worst-case swine flu scenarios, they say nothing of the experience of those in the southern hemisphere, which just finished their flu season and found it was not as bad as expected.
CBS News Finds H1N1 Tests ""Overwhelmingly Negative""
Before beginning their investigation, CBS News asked the CDC for state-by-state test results prior to their halting of testing and tracking. The CDC did not initially respond so CBS went to all 50 states directly, asking for their statistics on state lab-confirmed H1N1 prior to the halt of individual testing and counting in July.
What did they find? CBS reported:
""The results reveal a pattern that surprised a number of health care professionals we consulted. The vast majority of cases were negative for H1N1 as well as seasonal flu, despite the fact that many states were specifically testing patients deemed to be most likely to have H1N1 flu, based on symptoms and risk factors, such as travel to Mexico.""
As you can see from this CBS News graphic, not only are most cases of suspected flu-like illnesses not H1N1, they're not even the flu but more likely some type of cold or upper respiratory infection!
(Image from CBS News)
Where is the CDC Getting Their Data?
Given CBS News' findings that most cases of flu-like illnesses are neither H1N1 nor the flu, it begs the question: Why is the CDC reporting that most flu in the United States is in fact H1N1?
Barbara Loe Fisher, founder of the National Vaccine Information Center who I spoke with in the interview above, was a consumer representative on the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee in 2003, and she asked the head of the influenza branch of the CDC how much of the flu-like illness that occurs in America every year is actually due to the flu.
The answer was about 20 percent, which corresponds more closely with the CBS News data from 2009.
According to the CBS News study, when you come down with chills, fever, cough, runny nose, malaise and all those other ""flu-like"" symptoms, the illness is likely caused by influenza at most 17 percent of the time and as little as 3 percent! The other 83 to 97 percent of the time it's caused by other viruses or bacteria.
So remember that not every illness that appears to be the flu actually is the flu. In fact, most of the time it's not.
Curiously, the CDC still advises those who were told they had 2009 H1N1 (and therefore should be immune to getting it again) to get vaccinated unless they had lab confirmation.
Is the CDC Purposely Misinforming the Public to Sell More Flu and H1N1 Vaccines?
Conflicts of interest are rampant in the vaccination infrastructure. The same people who are regulating and promoting vaccines are also evaluating vaccine safety.
For instance, Dr. Paul Offit of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia earned at least $29 million as part of a $182-million sale by the hospital of its worldwide royalty interest in the Merck Rotateq vaccine. He also formerly sat on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to help create the market for rotavirus vaccine
This type of conflict of interest has been going on for some time.
In August 1999, the Committee on Government Reform initiated an investigation into Federal vaccine policy. During the investigation the Committee extensively reviewed financial disclosure forms and related documents and interviewed key officials from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC.
It was revealed that many individuals on two key advisory committees had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines. These individuals were even granted waivers allowing them to fully participate in discussions about vaccine licensing and recommendations for children, despite the fact that federal law states members of advisory committees are required to disclose such ties and recuse themselves from such discussions and decisions.
Further, the investigation revealed that the FDA's and CDC's conflict of interest rules were not strongly enforced while the rules themselves were weak. Specific problems noted by the Committee included:
The CDC routinely granted waivers from conflict of interest rules to many members of its advisory committee.
Those CDC advisory committee members who were not allowed to vote on certain recommendations due to financial conflicts of interest were still allowed to actively participate in committee deliberations and advocate specific positions.
The Chairman of the CDC's advisory committee owned 600 shares of stock in Merck, a pharmaceutical company with an active vaccine division.
Members of the CDC's advisory committee often left key details out of their financial disclosure statements, and were not required to provide the missing information by CDC ethics officials.
And, when the FDA and CDC approved the controversial rotavirus vaccine in 1998 and 1999, the Committee's report said:
3 out of the 5 FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December 1997 had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.
4 out of the 8 CDC advisory committee members who voted to approve guidelines for the rotavirus vaccine in June 1998 had financial ties to pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.
The rotavirus vaccine was pulled from the market one year after approval, after it was found to cause severe bowel obstructions.
Given their sordid history, can the CDC really be trusted, even today? Do you think that much has changed in just one decade?
Is the H1N1 Vaccine Really Safe as the CDC Says it Is?
CDC officials are screaming that H1N1 is so different from the seasonal influenza strains that have circulated in the past few decades that a national alarm must be sounded and everyone needs to be so afraid that we all should get vaccinated to prevent a deadly pandemic.
Yet, they say the new H1N1 vaccine is safe based on vaccines for that very same flu strain from which it is so different. They write on their Web site ""the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines are expected to have similar safety profiles as seasonal flu vaccines ...""
Another contradiction.
While symptoms of H1N1 flu and seasonal flu are virtually identical, the H1N1 vaccine is showing signs of being quite different from the seasonal flu shot.
Although both are produced using antiquated 50-year-old technology that involves injecting the virus into eggs and allowing it to grow, the virus being used to produce the swine flu vaccine has been found to reproduce much more slowly in eggs than the ordinary flu virus.
And according to a separate CBS News report, the U.S. government is now funding newer unprecedented technologies to speed up vaccine production, including one that involves growing the virus inside animal cells and another that involves flu proteins grown inside insect cells.
The risks of these, and the current fast-tracked swine flu vaccine, are truly unknown at this time.
There is NO Incentive for the CDC or Vaccine Manufacturers to Care About Safety
You may think that the CDC and the vaccine manufacturers must be concerned about safety, as if they released a dangerous vaccine and promoted it to the American public, imagine the lawsuits they would face.
This is actually no longer reality as the U.S. government has granted vaccine makers total legal immunity from any lawsuits that result from the new swine flu vaccine.
In fact, drug manufacturers got a major boost in protection and were granted unprecedented powers to experiment on the population with the passing of the 2006 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (the PREP Act).
This law allows the DHHS Secretary to invoke almost complete immunity from liability for manufacturers of vaccines and drugs used to combat a declared public health emergency, which the ""swine flu pandemic"" qualifies as.
The PREP Act removes your right to a trial jury unless you can provide clear evidence of willful misconduct that resulted in death or serious physical injury. But that's not all. First you must apply for and be granted permission to sue by the DHHS Secretary.
The most problematic aspect of the PREP Act is that it removes all financial incentive to make a safe product.
In fact, vaccine makers now have a negative incentive to test it for safety, because if they are aware of problems, then they could potentially be held liable for willful misconduct!
As long as they can prove they ""didn't know"" of any problem, they will not be liable for damages. Hence it's in their best interest to know as little as possible about the adverse reactions it might cause.
It seems unimaginable, but you and your children are now being enlisted as an unpaid human trial subjects for experimental, fast-tracked vaccines like the swine flu vaccine.
Even if They Were Effective or Safe, Most Vaccines Will Come Too Late
Recent national polls have revealed that 30 percent to 50 percent in many communities are not planning to get a swine flu shot ... but there are many who are still ready to stand in line.
If you have not yet made up your mind and have questions, we have created some fact-filled posters that you can print and post ALL over your community, your local stores, office and schools.
You can also visit the special section of my site that is devoted to giving you all the latest H1N1 Swine Flu Alerts. This is an excellent go-to source to stay updated on all the new swine flu developments.
But I wanted to share one final detail, and that is a new study just released by Purdue University researchers and published in the journal Eurosurveillance.
The researchers found that at this point in time any vaccinations that are given in the United States will likely have little effect on the number of infections. The researchers state:
""The model predicts that there will be a significant wave in autumn, with 63% of the population being infected, and that this wave will peak so early that the planned CDC vaccination campaign will likely not have a large effect on the total number of people ultimately infected by the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus.""
In other words, infections are predicted to peak in late October (now) and by the end of the year it's estimated that 63 percent of the U.S. population will have been infected with H1N1 swine flu.
What does this mean? By the end of the year the majority of the U.S. population will have likely acquired natural immunity.
Natural immunity is what you gain when you recover from influenza and natural immunity is what is protecting older Americans, who have recovered from exposure to H1N1 strains of influenza in the past and are therefore less susceptible today.
This new revelation, coupled with CBS News' finding that swine flu cases are already being greatly overestimated ... and the fact that vaccines do not offer long-term immunity anyway ... and the questionable motives behind CDC's massive vaccination campaign ... puts an entirely different slant on the swine flu ""epidemic,"" don't you think?
If you are still concerned about the swine flu, you should know that it is relatively easy to improve your immune response to fight this infection. If 99.9% of the people are not having any serious complications from H1N1, it would seem perfectly rational to believe that minor lifestyle changes could have dramatic effects on fighting this infection, and none of these involve taking potentially dangerous and unproven vaccine interventions.
Simple Measures That Can Help You Fight Illness
Vitamin D has been well documented to increase the production of over 200 anti microbial peptides that fight infection.
Eliminate sugar from your diet as that will impair your immune response
Get plenty of rest
Exercise appropriately

Although the paper is carefully worded and the results reported modestly, these findings are certain to receive intense scrutiny. The vast majority of American infants born during the 1990’s received a vaccine formulation similar to the one the thirteen vaccinated primates received.

Thimerosal-containing vaccines are still routinely administered to newborn infants in developing countries such as Brazil, and most influenza vaccines contain thimerosal and are routinely administered to pregnant women and infants.
The finding that early exposure to potentially toxic vaccine formulations can cause significant neurodevelopmental delays in primates has explosive implications for vaccine safety management.
But while Americans are still debating whether to roll up their sleeves for a swine flu shot, companies have already figured it out: vaccines are good for business.
Drug companies have sold $1.5 billion worth of swine flu shots, in addition to the $1 billion for seasonal flu they booked earlier this year. These inoculations are part of a much wider and rapidly growing $20 billion global vaccine market.
""The vaccine market is booming,"" says Bruce Carlson, spokesperson at market research firm Kalorama, which publishes an annual survey of the vaccine industry. ""It's an enormous growth area for pharmaceuticals at a time when other areas are not doing so well,"" he says, noting that the pipeline for more traditional blockbuster drugs such as Lipitor and Nexium has thinned.

Drugmakers benefit most from the revenues from flu sales, with Sanofi-Pasteur, Glaxo Smith Kline and Novartis cornering most of the market.

Thimerosal has been eliminated from most vaccines in the United States, and the compound may  be linked to autism. But it will be added to the bulk of swine-flu vaccines.
Thimerosal will be added to the vaccine because it is being produced in vials that contain enough medication for 10 shots. The mercury compound kills bacteria, lowering the risk that the drug will be contaminated by needles used to withdraw separate doses.
A smaller amount of mercury-free vaccine will be produced in single-dose vials. Nasal sprays do not contain mercury but are not recommended for children under the age of 2 and pregnant women, because they contain live, weakened virus.

During a recent episode on his talk show, a Walgreens pharmacist gave Dr. Oz a flu shot -- which was also given to everyone in his studio audience. (Unfortunately, we cannot post that clip, but you can view that segment here.)
He states that he's been getting the seasonal flu vaccine every year for about ten years.
But what you didn't see in that clip was Dr. Oz stating that when it comes to the swine flu shot, neither his wife nor his four children will get the vaccine (although he will get that one too). This comes up during interviews on both Fox News and CNN, shown in the two videos above.
It's amazing how many doctors have been hoodwinked into believing that the flu shot is a necessity.
Fortunately, he acquiesces to a far healthier approach as it pertains to the rest of his family, and his wife and children will be spared the toxic burden and other potential health hazards inherent with the swine flu vaccine.
It's far less surprising how many corporations are happy to promote the belief that you need a flu shot every year, given how much money they're making off of useless flu vaccines.
Study after study keeps coming to the same conclusion: Flu vaccines DO NOT WORK, and in many cases do more harm than good.
In fact, before the CDC advocated vaccinating children under the age of five, the number of children dying from the flu was very low, and on the decline. Then, in 2003, just after children aged five and under started getting vaccinated, the number of flu deaths skyrocketed.

If you still believe sweeteners like Equal and NutraSweet are safe, you'll want to pay very close attention to this special report.
You're probably aware of the dangers of consuming too much sugar and that sugar is not healthy for you. You might have been led to believe that artificial sweeteners like aspartame are safer and less likely to cause you to gain weight.
Well, neither of those beliefs is true.
Slick marketing of products containing aspartame by giants in the food industry -- especially marketing that sends the message it's healthy to consume these products -- might be giving you a false sense of security.
You might even be convinced you're doing the right thing for your health and the health of your family by using products artificially sweetened with aspartame.
You couldn't be more mistaken.
It's not pleasant to learn that corporations, government-sponsored regulatory agencies, and politicians are more interested in lining their pockets than protecting your health and the health of your loved ones. But unfortunately, these are serious issues that you must consider for your and your family's safety.
Manufacturers, marketers, and others with financial interests have successfully convinced millions of consumers the chemicals used in artificially sweetened products are safe. Don't believe them! The arguments used to convince you these ingredients are healthy and ""natural"" will be addressed later in this report.
For now, just keep in mind that the reason you feel products containing aspartame are safe is a direct result of deliberate deception on the part of big business and government. Remember:
If you're consuming a food or beverage created in a lab instead of by nature, you can be assured your body doesn't recognize it. This opens the door to short-term and long-lasting health problems for you and your family.
If you already avoid aspartame, the information you're about to read will confirm the wise choice you've made, and cement your resolve to stay away from any product that contains this potential toxin.
An Accident Waiting to Happen: The Birth of Aspartame
Like an omen, aspartame was discovered in 1965 entirely by mistake. That's right ... by mistake.
G.D. Searle chemist James M. Schlatter was at work in his laboratory developing a drug to treat peptic ulcer disease. The story goes that Schlatter accidentally spilled one of the chemicals he was using onto his finger. He licked his finger clean, and in doing so discovered the sweet taste of the aspartame he had spilled.1
This inauspicious beginning heralded the birth of what has become one of the most potentially dangerous and controversial food additives in human history.
How Aspartame Got to Market in Spite of Itself
As you're about to learn, the tale of how aspartame got to market is a disturbing one. It reads like a crime mystery. One you would assume is based on the author's over-active imagination. Except it's all true.
The approval process for aspartame was said to have been riddled with scandal, bribes, and other shady dealings within the pharmaceutical industry, large American corporations, and the FDA. Initially, the FDA strongly denied the approval of aspartame products. Reasons given were sound and included:
Flawed data
Brain tumor findings in animal studies
Lack of studies on humans to determine longer-term effects

How aspartame got to market despite initial FDA concerns and evidence of its neurotoxicity is a study in good timing, heavy financial investment, and the impact of political clout.
Timing Is Everything
Aspartame studies were on the rise just after cyclamate was pulled from the U.S. market and saccharin was under serious scrutiny. The disappearance of cyclamate left a void it appeared saccharin might not be poised to fill.
At the time of the cyclamate ban, the ""diet"" market was a $1 billion dollar per year business in the U.S.2 Manufacturers of diet products were in a mad scramble to find a substitute product that would insure they left not a dollar of that billion on the table.
Pouring Good Money Into Bad Studies
G.D. Searle spent tens of millions of dollars to conduct the necessary approval tests on aspartame. Not surprisingly, studies funded by Searle and other groups with a financial interest in aspartame found no adverse health effects. However, independent studies delivered evidence that aspartame consumption did indeed create health problems in test subjects.
Flexing Political Muscle
In addition to its enormous financial investment in favorable study results, Searle developed what can be fairly described as a diabolical political strategy to insure the FDA would end up with a positive view of aspartame.
Deceptive Safety Studies
G.D. Searle provided the FDA with over 100 aspartame studies in early 1973. Later that same year, the FDA asked for additional studies. Searle complied, and in June 1974, the FDA granted preliminary approval for the restricted use of aspartame.
The study findings submitted by Searle were immediately challenged by Dr. John Olney, a neuroscientist who was instrumental in getting monosodium glutamate removed from baby foods, and Jim Turner, an attorney and consumer advocate.3
In August 1974, Olney and Turner filed the first formal objections to the approval of aspartame. Their petition prompted the FDA to initiate investigations into Searle's lab practices.
The investigations ultimately led to concerns within the FDA about the validity of the studies submitted by Searle. Investigators uncovered substandard testing procedures and manipulated test data. In fact, what investigators found at Searle was an unprecedented incidence of bad testing procedures and inaccurate results. Final approval of aspartame was delayed.
Based on the results of these findings, in January 1977, for the first time in history, the FDA requested a criminal investigation into a food manufacturer for willfully misrepresenting results in their safety tests of a product. The FDA asked the U.S. Attorney's office to examine Searle's handling of aspartame testing.4
In August 1977, the FDA published a report by Jerome Bressler which pointed to specific issues with Searle's aspartame safety studies.5
The Bressler Report revealed stunning examples of very bad research. A few examples included:
Deceased lab animals were not immediately autopsied, some not for an entire year after death. Decomposition rendered any data from them inaccurate.
Tumors found in lab animals were reportedly cut out and thrown away.
Animals from whom tumors were removed were labeled ""normal,"" and obvious tumors were deemed to be ""normal swelling.""

In 1979, the FDA established a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) to rule on safety issues with aspartame, with the result that NutraSweet would not receive final approval pending further investigation into its link to brain tumors in animals.
Political and Regulatory Dirty Tricks
During the 1977 criminal investigation initiated by the FDA, the law firm representing G.D. Searle arranged to hire away the U.S. Attorney leading the investigation. Samuel Skinner went to work for Searle in July. Skinner's resignation from the U.S. Attorney's office stalled the investigation into Searle's aspartame studies until the statute of limitations expired. The investigation was subsequently abandoned.
In March 1977, Donald Rumsfeld was hired as the CEO of Searle -- yes, the same Rumsfeld that was the Secretary of Defense in the Bush administration. He brought with him additional political clout by appointing several of his D.C. associates to top management positions.
In January 1981, Rumsfeld proclaimed he would get aspartame approved within one year.6 Worthy of note is the fact Rumsfeld was part of newly elected President Ronald Reagan's transition team -- a team which had carefully selected Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes Jr. as the new FDA Commissioner. Two months later, in March, Dr. Hayes appointed an internal panel to review the 1979 decision by the Public Board of Inquiry that ruled thumbs down on final approval of NutraSweet.
Three of the five members of Dr. Hayes' panel advised against approval of aspartame, citing on the record that Searle's safety study tests were flawed. Hayes then appointed a sixth member to the panel who tied the vote three-three. Dr. Hayes then cast the deciding vote in favor of approval.
Hayes, an official with no background on the subject of food additives, claimed aspartame was safe for proposed use, and had undergone more testing and scientific scrutiny than most additives on the market. Shortly after approving this drug he resigned from the FDA panel and was hired by the manufacturer of aspartame for a position in which he was paid several hundred thousand dollars per year.
So, despite all the game playing and countless unresolved safety issues, aspartame was approved for use in soft drinks in the fall of 1983. Less than a year later, the FDA had recorded 600 consumer complaints of headaches, dizziness and other health-related reactions from aspartame consumption. The unprecedented number of complaints caused the FDA to call in the CDC (Centers for Disease Control). The CDC concluded adverse reactions to aspartame were occurring in ""unusually sensitive"" individuals, but there was not enough evidence to prove existence of wide-spread health problems attributable to its consumption.7
What is Aspartame, Exactly?
Aspartame goes by the brand names NutraSweet and Equal. It is one of the first generation of artificial sweeteners and is 180 times as sweet as sugar. At the end of 2008, aspartame was found in over 6,000 products including:
Carbonated soft drinks
Puddings and fillings
Powdered soft drinks
Frozen desserts
Chewing gum
Yogurt
Confections
Tabletop sweeteners
Gelatins
Chewable vitamins
Dessert mixes
Sugar-free cough drops
Products containing aspartame are sold in over 100 countries and are consumed by over 250 million people worldwide. The scientific name for aspartame is 1-aspartyl 1 phenylalanine methyl ester. It has three components:
Phenylalanine which makes up 50 percent of the chemical by weight
Aspartic acid -- 40 percent
Methanol (wood alcohol) -- 10 percent
How Aspartame Acts Inside Your Body
The two primary components of aspartame, phenylalanine and aspartic acid, are amino acids that are combined in an ester bond. You normally consume these two amino acids in the foods you eat. These amino acids are harmless when consumed as part of natural unprocessed foods. However, when they are chemically manipulated and consumed out of the normal ratios to other amino acids, they can cause problems.
Your body initially breaks down the ester link between the two amino acids to turn them into free amino acids. The neurotoxic effects of these chemicals in their ""free form"" can result in immediate health consequences such as headaches, mental confusion, dizziness, and seizures.
Your body does require small amounts of these amino acids to function properly. However, the high concentration of these chemicals in the form of aspartame floods your central nervous system and can cause excessive firing of brain neurons. Cell death is also possible.
This is a condition called excitotoxicity. Your body doesn't recognize phenylalanine and aspartic acid in their free form, but your system will try to manage them through metabolization. Whenever your body tries to process an unrecognizable substance, the stage is set for health problems. The chemicals in aspartame will be absorbed by your intestinal cells, where they will be broken down into other amino acids and byproducts. A large percentage of the absorbed chemicals will be used immediately in your small intestine.
A Formaldehyde Cocktail
Ultimately, aspartame will be fully absorbed into your body. Ten percent of what is absorbed is the breakdown product methanol (wood alcohol). The EPA defines safe consumption of this toxin as 7.8 milligrams a day, which is the amount found in about half a can of diet soda.
It's not the amino acids themselves or the methanol that are toxic to your system. It's the breakdown products they turn into along the way -- either during transport, on the store shelf, or during the metabolization process.
Stored at warm temperatures or for a prolonged period of time, phenylalanine turns into diketopiperazine, a known carcinogen. Methanol can spontaneously break down to formaldehyde, also a toxin, which can accumulate in your cells and result in severe health consequences.
Methanol is found naturally in some of the foods you eat. However, it is never bound to amino acids in nature, as it is as an ingredient in aspartame. In nature, for example, methanol is bound to pectin. Pectin is a fiber which allows the methanol to pass through your body without being metabolized and converted to formaldehyde.8
Since methanol in aspartame has no natural binder, nearly all of it turns into formaldehyde in your body. Formaldehyde (which is used in, among other things, paint remover and embalming fluid) is a poison several thousand times more potent than ethyl alcohol.
The EPA has determined formaldehyde causes cancer in humans. Specifically, it is known to increase your risk of breast or prostate cancer. Incidents of both types of cancer have been on the rise at a pace closely associated with the expanding use of aspartame throughout the world.9 The EPA has also concluded there is no known ""safe"" level of formaldehyde in your body -- risk depends on the amount and duration of your exposure.
The end waste product of formaldehyde is formate. An accumulation of formate in your body can cause metabolic acidosis, which is excessive acidity in your blood. Metabolic acidosis can cause methanol poisoning and can result in blindness, fatal kidney damage, multiple organ system failure, and death.10
The Major Element of Aspartame -- Phenylalanine
Your body converts the amino acid phenylalanine to neurotransmitters that regulate your brain chemistry. These important neurotransmitters are:
L-dopa
norepinephrine
epinephrine

However, if your system is flooded with phenylalanine as a result of an aspartame overdose, the resulting increased levels of neurotransmitters can cause problems in the physiology of your brain -- problems which have been linked to a variety of psychiatric disorders. You can also be prone to anxiety attacks, depression, headaches, seizures, and tremors.
If you consume too much aspartame in a short period of time, you might also experience immediate reactions including nervousness, sweating, feelings of fear, and heart palpitations. In pregnancy, the concentrating effects of the placenta can magnify phenylalanine levels in a baby's blood by as much as four to six-fold, and can reach levels so high that cell death results.11 It's not much of a stretch to be concerned consumption of high doses of this chemical during pregnancy could result in birth defects.
The genetic disease phenylketonuria (PKU) is a condition in which your body is unable to use phenylalanine at all. If a toxic buildup occurs, it can result in mental retardation. People with PKU must avoid all sources of phenylalanine, including aspartame.
Aspartic Acid and Cell Death
The second largest component of aspartame is aspartic acid. Aspartic acid functions as a major excitatory neurotransmitter in your brain. People who suffer from depression or have brain atrophy have been found to have low levels of aspartic acid in their bodies. As you might expect, the chemical is found in abnormally high levels in people who suffer from seizures and strokes. In very high doses, aspartic acid can cause brain damage.
The term excitotoxicity was coined by Dr. Russell Blaylock, a neurosurgeon.12 It describes the ability of certain amino acids like monosodium glutamate (MSG) and aspartic acid to literally excite cells to death.
The scientific community has shown widespread acceptance of Dr. Olney's concept of excitotoxins and its link to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
Unfortunately, the FDA refuses to acknowledge the connection between free form amino acids and excitotoxicity. Consequently, no demands have been made of food manufacturers to eliminate chemicals like MSG and aspartic acid from the food supply.
Excitotoxins can also encourage the production of free radicals. Free radicals can damage tissues and organs throughout your body and may accelerate diseases like arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and coronary artery disease.13, 14
Your blood brain barrier (BBB) is a system of capillary structures that prevent toxins from entering your brain.If you have diabetes, hypertension, or are a smoker, your BBB may be compromised and you might experience a heightened reaction to aspartame. Unborn children and infants up to one year of age have incomplete and not well-insulated BBB's. Excitotoxins enter their nervous systems easily and quickly. Babies under a year are four times more sensitive to excitotoxins than adults.
During the first year of life, irreversible brain damage can result from chemicals in breast milk that have crossed the unborn child's blood brain barrier. And yet -- few if any pregnant and breastfeeding women are warned of the dangers of consuming artificial sweeteners.
Are Your Health Problems Related to Aspartame Consumption?
You might not realize you're having a reaction to aspartame. In fact, most people don't make the connection, and a tremendous amount of time and money is spent by aspartame ""reactors"" (people sensitive to the chemical), trying to find out why they are sick. To determine if you're a reactor, eliminate all artificial sweeteners from your diet. If you typically consume aspartame in caffeinated drinks, you'll want to gradually reduce your intake in order to avoid caffeine withdrawal symptoms. After one to two weeks of being artificial sweetener-free, take note of how you feel, especially as compared to when you were consuming the sweeteners.
If you don't notice any significant difference in how you feel, it's likely you're able to tolerate aspartame acutely, meaning your body doesn't have an immediate, adverse response. However, this doesn't mean your health won't be damaged in the long run by this chemical and its breakdown products. My advice is to remain artificial sweetener-free, whether or not you notice an immediate difference in your health. If you notice a positive change in how you feel after stopping aspartame, chances are your body has a particular sensitivity to this toxin.
Formate, which is the waste product of formaldehyde, is suspected of inducing poly chemical hypersensitivity (PCS) in some individuals. If your body develops acute sensitivity to multiple chemicals, you may be unable to tolerate relatively low exposure to preservatives, perfumes and other substances, many of which are unavoidable as you go about your daily life.
Whether or not you're an aspartame reactor, keep in mind aspartame is completely metabolized by the human body, and its byproducts can create a serious risk to your health. Neurological damage can occur from long-term aspartame use.
Adverse Reactions to Aspartame
There have been more reports to the FDA for aspartame reactions than for all other food additives combined. And, there are over 900 published studies on the health hazards of aspartame. You can find a list in the National Library Medicine Index. There are also some 10,000 documented reports of adverse reactions to aspartame, including death. Since it is estimated only about one percent of people who experience a reaction report it, it is safe to assume at least a million people have had a reaction to this chemical. Migraines are by far the most frequently reported reaction. Other commonly reported symptoms of an aspartame reaction include:
Headache
Change in mood
Change in vision
Convulsions and seizures
Sleep problems/insomnia
Change in heart rate
Hallucination
Abdominal cramps/pain
Memory loss
Rash
Nausea and vomiting
Fatigue and weakness
Dizziness/poor equilibrium
Diarrhea
Hives
Joint pain
Debilitating, Life-Threatening Conditions Linked to Aspartame
Aspartame has been implicated in a number of diseases, and there is special concern among doctors and scientists regarding the role aspartame plays in migraine headaches, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Aspartame has been identified as a definitive causative factor in the following serious health concerns:
• Migraine Headaches
Aspartame has been shown to trigger migraines, and to cause more frequent, severe headaches in regular sufferers. This is especially true with long-term exposure to the chemical.
• Seizures
In the mid-1990s, a hotline was established specifically for pilots to report acute adverse reactions to aspartame. The hotline received several hundred calls from pilots complaining about reactions to the chemical, including many who suffered grand mal seizures while in the cockpit. In 1992, the United States Air Force issued a warning to pilots to avoid products containing aspartame because it has been linked to seizures and vertigo, dizziness, sudden memory loss, and gradual loss of vision.
Seizures are a primary side effect of aspartame consumption. As if that weren't disturbing enough, they occur in people who've never had a seizure before, and disappear just as quickly when aspartame consumption is stopped. MIT conducted a survey of 80 seizure sufferers. Survey results showed the role aspartame played in those seizures met FDA criteria for an imminent hazard to the public's health.15 This measure is what the FDA normally relies upon to pull unsafe products from the market. Products other than aspartame, apparently.
• Depression
A study begun at Northeastern Ohio University to determine whether aspartame was linked to depression had to be halted. Can you guess why?
Nearly a third of the test subjects in the depressive group dropped out due to the severity of their reactions to aspartame consumption. Two others left the study due to serious eye problems -- one developed a detached retina that ultimately led to blindness, and the other experienced a bleeding conjunctiva of the eye.
• Visual Changes
The individual ingredients in aspartame as well as their breakdown products can do serious harm to your retina and optic nerves. Aspartame has been linked to blurred vision, eye pain, visual hallucinations, and blindness. Formaldehyde is known to cause retinal damage, and methanol poisoning can lead to changes in your vision and ultimately, blindness.
According to Dr. H.J. Roberts, an expert on aspartame who has treated hundreds of patients with sensitivity to the chemical, the visual problems seen in frequent aspartame users are identical to those found in people who developed methanol poisoning from wood alcohol during the era of prohibition.
• Brain Cancer
The subject of aspartame and cancer continues to be controversial. However, there is sufficient evidence of a link to warn off anyone who is concerned about maintaining good health. On the heels of its approval for use in diet soda in 1983, over a million pounds of aspartame was consumed. Less than a year later, in January 1984, the incidence of brain cancer took off at a rate far higher than any other type of cancer.16
According to the National Cancer Institute, there was a 10 percent increase in malignant brain cancer in 1985 -- just two years after aspartame flooded the market in diet beverages. Young women who drink large quantities of aspartame-laced diet drinks are especially susceptible to developing three specific types of brain cancer:
<U+25E6> Alioblastoma
<U+25E6> Astrocytoma
<U+25E6> Primary lymphoma
Equally alarming is evidence women of childbearing age who consumed aspartame during pregnancy were delivering babies with an increased risk of brain and spinal cord cancer.17, 18
• Aspartame and Weight Gain
Would it surprise you to learn aspartame may cause you to gain weight? It's true -- products marketed as ""reduced calorie,"" ""sugar-free,"" and ""diet"" can actually sabotage your weight control efforts.19 The two main ingredients of aspartame, phenylalanine and aspartic acid, stimulate the release of insulin and leptin -- hormones which instruct your body to store fat. In addition, a large intake of phenylalanine can drive down your serotonin levels. Serotonin is the neurotransmitter that tells you when you're full. A low level of serotonin can bring on food cravings which can lead to weight gain.20
What Will You Do, Now That You Know?
I hope this report has convinced you one of the worst things you can put into your body, or feed to your family, is the artificial sweetener aspartame. You can read more about aspartame and other artificial sweeteners in my comprehensive book, Sweet Deception, as well as in the outstanding book by H.J. Roberts, Aspartame Disease -- An Ignored Epidemic. I also recommend you watch the excellent documentary Sweet Misery.
Neotame: The 'New and Improved' Aspartame
You'll also want to be on the lookout for this modified version of aspartame, as it likely carries similar health risks to the original. Neotame is chemically related to aspartame, but has greater heat stability and is 72 times sweeter.
Breaking the Cycle
If you consume a lot of ""diet"" products, you probably have cravings for sweet foods and beverages. Why? Because if your body isn't receiving the fuel it needs in the right combinations, you'll develop sweet cravings. To optimize your diet, you'll want to determine your nutritional type, and begin to eat the kinds of foods your body requires.
When you are eating right for your nutritional type, your sweet cravings will disappear. There may also be an emotional component to your cravings. If so, you'll need to address it, as well. I highly recommend the Meridian Tapping Technique, or MTT. You can find links to information about nutritional typing, MTT, and a wealth of other resources to help you kick your artificial sweetener habit at my website, www.Mercola.com.
I can't overstate the importance of avoiding aspartame to your short and long-term health, the quality of your life, and the lives of your loved ones. I hope you'll take this information to heart and eliminate aspartame and other artificial sweeteners from your diet.

People with the highest average levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D had a cancer-specific mortality half that of people with the lowest average levels. What’s more, high levels of the vitamin were associated with an overall mortality level 40 percent lower than people with the lowest average levels.
Knowledge of the link between vitamin D intake and protection from cancer dates from the 1940’s, when Frank Apperly demonstrated a link between latitude and deaths from cancer, and suggested that sunlight gave “a relative cancer immunity”.
Vitamin D Dose Recommendations
Age Dosage
Below 5 35 units per pound per day
Age 5 - 10 2500 units
Adults 5000 units
Pregnant Women 5000 units
WARNING: There is no way to know if the above recommendations are correct. The ONLY way to know is to test your blood. You might need 4-5 times the amount recommended above. Ideally your blood level of 25 OH D should be 60ng/ml.
  Colon cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death in the United States. According to the latest data from the CDC, more than 141,400 Americans were diagnosed with colon cancer in 2005, and more than 53,000 died from the disease that same year.
Fortunately, it is also one of the few cancers that can be successfully treated if precancerous growths are found and removed early enough. Better yet, I believe colon cancer is completely preventable with certain lifestyle changes, of which vitamin D is a vital part.
More Evidence Showing the Cancer-Busting Power of Vitamin D
In this latest study, people with colon cancer who had the highest average levels of vitamin D had half the mortality rate of those with the lowest average levels, indicating that optimizing your vitamin D levels can improve your survival rate even if you already have the disease.
These findings add to a veritable mountain of studies that have found vitamin D to generate astounding powers of protection against a wide variety of cancers. In fact, there are well over 800 studies showing vitamin D’s effectiveness for cancer prevention and treatment!
One 2003 study in JAMA found that men who consumed higher amounts of vitamin D significantly reduced their risk of developing colon cancer.
Another study dating back to 1989 studied more than 25,000 people for eight years and discovered that people with vitamin D levels of 33-41 ng/ml, which is not even close to a great vitamin D level, reduced their risk of colon cancer by a whopping 80 percent!
Considering the fact that anything below 50 ng/ml is now believed to be sub-optimal, just imagine the worldwide impact on colon cancer (and other types of cancer) might be if everyone raised their vitamin D levels to the recommended 50-65 ng/ml.
For cancer treatment, the recommended level is now as high as 65-90 ng/ml.
I can’t stress enough how important I believe it is to optimize your vitamin D levels. It’s such a simple, inexpensive strategy, yet it can help prevent countless chronic ailments and deadly diseases.
For dosing guidelines, please read through last week’s article which addressed this in detail: “Vitamin D Experts Reveal the Truth About Vitamin D Dosing for Children and Adults.” I also recommend you review “Test Values and Treatment for Vitamin D Deficiency,” if you have not done so already.
How to Prevent Colon Cancer
Cancer can be a terrible disease, but please understand that you can easily avoid cancers of nearly every type by implementing some basic healthy lifestyle changes.
There are several dietary factors that appear to play a protective role, and as discussed above, one of the most important and simplest ones is to optimize your vitamin D levels. The best way to do that is by getting plenty of appropriate sunshine exposure on a regular basis, or by using a safe tanning bed.
If you’re still holding onto the myth that sun exposure equals deadly skin cancer, my book, Dark Deception, reveals why listening to that advice can literally kill you in more ways than one.
Other proven preventive measures for colon cancer include:
Exercise
Eat plenty of fresh raw vegetables, ideally based on your body's unique nutritional type
Rebalance the ratio of omega-3 fats  you consume by taking a high-quality fish oil or krill oil
Avoid sugar
Avoid processed meats
Maintain normal iron levels
Have your inflammation levels checked by having your C-reactive protein levels tested, and reduce them, if necessary
Be wary of water soluble fiber as it may actually increase your risk of colon cancer. This was quite surprising to me, who was known as Dr. Fiber in medical school.

WARNING: There is no way to know if the above recommendations are correct. The ONLY way to know is to test your blood. You might need four to five times the amount recommended above. Ideally, your blood level of 25(OH)D should be 60ng/ml.
  As more and more scientific evidence emerges, confirming that currently recommended daily allowances (RDA) of vitamin D are grossly insufficient for young and old alike, many have asked me to clarify the recommended dosages, especially as it pertains to children.
General Information About Adult Vitamin D Requirements
Before I begin, I want to emphasize that under summer conditions it is frequently possible to generate about 20,000 units of vitamin D by exposing your skin to the sun. That fact makes these recommendations seem more in line with reality.
Currently, the U.S. RDA for vitamin D is 400 IUs (international units) for the majority of the population. (IU is frequently shortened to just “units.”) This dose was recommended to prevent rickets, which works well, but does nothing to give the far more important protection from cancer, heart disease, and infections.
To achieve the healthy blood levels in the graph below, most adults will need about EIGHT THOUSAND units of vitamin D every day. Interestingly, the majority of people I see in my travels that are taking vitamin D are taking 1,000 units, and they believe they are taking “high” doses. Don’t fool yourself, as an adult, you likely need about 8,000 IUs a day.
Some also worry that if they are in the sun that they will overdose on vitamin D.
However this is not typically the case, and here’s why: When you’re exposed to the sun, the UVB rays cause vitamin D to be produced in your skin while the UVA rays in the sunlight will tend to destroy excessive levels of vitamin D circulating in your body. It is somewhat of a natural failsafe mechanism that prevents overdosing.
HOWEVER, please understand that about 10 percent or more of the people reading this needs significantly more than 8,000 units. I have seen people requiring over 30,000 units of vitamin D a day to reach therapeutic levels of 25 hydroxy D in their blood.
Please remember that the ONLY way to know for sure is to get your blood level tested, which I’ll go over in just a moment.
Current RDA Guidelines for Vitamin D Are Outdated in Light of New Research
At the end of 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics doubled its recommended dose of vitamin D  for infants, children, and adolescents, raising it from 200 to 400 units per day.
Unfortunately, this is still a woefully inadequate recommendation for children.
Research reveals children may need ten times that amount in order to receive the health benefits that optimal vitamin D levels have to offer.
As of right now, the conventional RDAs are only:
400 IUs for infants, children and adolescents
200 IUs for adults up to age 50
400 IUs for adults aged 51 to 70
600 IUs for seniors over 70
Recommended Daily Intake for Optimal Health
Based on the most recent research, the current recommendation is 35 IUs of vitamin D per pound of body weight.
So for a child weighing 40 pounds, the recommended average dose would be 1,400 IUs daily, and for a 170-pound adult, the dose would be nearly 6,000 IUs.
However, it’s important to realize that vitamin D requirements are highly individual, as your vitamin D status is dependent on numerous factors, such as the color of your skin, your location, and how much sunshine you’re exposed to on a regular basis.
So, although these recommendations may put you closer to the ballpark of what most people likely need, it is simply impossible to make a blanket recommendation that will cover everyone’s needs.
So how do you ensure optimal vitamin D levels for yourself, your child, and aging parents?
Blood Testing Is the ONLY Reliable Way to Determine How Much Vitamin D You or Your Child Needs
Yes, the only way to determine the correct dose is to get your blood tested since there are so many variables that influence your vitamin D status.
I recommend using Lab Corp in the U.S.  
Step 1: Make Sure You Use the Correct Test
Getting the correct test is the first step in this process, as there are TWO vitamin D tests currently being offered: 1,25(OH)D, and 25(OH)D.
The correct test your doctor needs to order is 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is the better marker of overall D status. This is the marker that is most strongly associated with overall health.
Step 2: Determine Your OPTIMAL Level of Vitamin D
It’s important to realize the difference between what conventional medicine considers to be “normal,” versus what is optimal.
The “normal” 25-hydroxyvitamin D lab range is between 20-56 ng/ml. As you can see in the chart below, this conventional range is really a sign of deficiency, and is too broad to be ideal.
In fact, your vitamin D level should never be below 32 ng/ml, and any levels below 20 ng/ml are considered serious deficiency states, increasing your risk of as many as 16 different cancers and autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, just to name a few.
The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 50-70 ng/ml.
This range applies for everyone; children, adolescents, adults, and seniors.
These ranges are based on healthy people in tropical or subtropical parts of the world, where they are receiving healthy sun exposures. It seems more than reasonable to assume that these values are in fact reflective of an optimal human requirement.
It’s worth to clarify here that ng/ml are U.S. units of measure. Much of the world uses nmol/l. If your test results are measured in nmol/l, simply multiply the above values by 2.5 to get the correct ranges.
Keeping your level in this range, and even erring toward the higher numbers in this range, is going to give you the most protective benefit. And the way you maintain your levels within this range is by getting tested regularly – say two to four times a year in the beginning, and adjusting your vitamin D intake accordingly.
Are Oral Vitamin D Supplements Your Best Choice?
The best way to optimize your vitamin D levels is through appropriate safe sunshine or safe tanning bed exposure. However, there are many times when it can be nearly impossible to get enough sun.
The darker your skin is, the farther away from the equator you are, and the further away you are from the summer months, the less likely it is that you will produce adequate vitamin D levels from sun exposure alone.
In these cases, supplementing with vitamin D is acceptable, but I strongly recommend you monitoring your blood levels regularly when taking oral vitamin D supplements to make sure you’re staying within the optimal range.
Only Supplement with the Right Kind of Vitamin D
There is one other thing you need to be aware of if you choose to use an oral vitamin D supplement and that is that there are basically two types – one is natural and one is synthetic.
The natural one is D3 (cholecalciferol), which is the same vitamin D your body makes when exposed to sunshine
The synthetic one is vitamin D2, which is sometimes called ergocalciferol
Once either form of the vitamin is in your body, it must be converted to a more active form. Vitamin D3 is converted 500 percent faster than vitamin D2, and is clearly a better alternative.
Vitamin D2 also has a shorter shelf life, and its metabolites bind with protein poorly, making it less effective. Studies have even concluded that vitamin D2 should no longer be regarded as a nutrient appropriate for supplementation or fortification of foods (although it continues to be used). So if you choose to use vitamin D supplements, make sure it is in the form of vitamin D3.
Please be aware that nearly all the prescription-based supplements contain synthetic vitamin D2, so if you receive a prescription for vitamin D from your doctor, you’re most likely receiving the inferior vitamin D2.
Getting the Word Out About the Benefits of Optimizing Vitamin D Levels
When it comes to the benefits of optimizing your vitamin D levels, the evidence is simply overwhelming. Research shows you can drastically reduce your risk of cancer and countless other chronic diseases by getting safe sun exposure, using a safe tanning bed, or taking a high-quality supplement.
Yet, a great deal of people around the world have heard nothing of this great “discovery.” It’s even likely that your doctor is among them, which is why it’s so important to educate yourself.
As a result of flawed assumptions about sun exposure, and the subsequent recommendations, a vast majority of people are deficient in vitamin D. It’s thought that over 95 percent of U.S. senior citizens may be deficient, along with 85 percent of the American public.
Clearly, the word needs to get out but the mainstream media is slow to react. Plus, there’s no money to be made on selling vitamin D (it’s one of the most inexpensive supplements around) and sun exposure is free! So don’t count on any major corporations or drug companies to help get the message out (rather, count on them to try and suppress this lifesaving information).
The longer this information goes largely unnoticed, the more people who will die unnecessarily from potentially preventable cancers and other diseases.
Fortunately, GrassrootsHealth D*Action is on a mission to get the word out and solve the vitamin D deficiency epidemic… in just one year’s time.
The D*Action Project: How YOU Can Make a Difference
GrassrootsHealth has launched a worldwide public health campaign to solve the vitamin D deficiency epidemic in a year through a focus on testing and education with all individuals spreading the word.
And you are all invited to join in this campaign!
With Dr. Garland at the helm, The D*Action Project will be monitoring, for five years, the health outcomes of individuals who get their vitamin D levels to the levels of 40-60 ng/ml. I would highly recommend that you optimize your levels to the high end of this spectrum, as optimal vitamin D levels are 50-65 ng/ml, or 65-90 ng/ml if you are treating cancer.
Says Carole Baggerly, director of GrassrootsHealth:
""We will be tracking the incidence of many diseases, from cancer to diabetes and muscular function as well as pain levels to see what effect the higher vitamin D levels may have.
We expect to see a significant reduction in the incidence of breast cancer (and its recurrence), colon cancer, diabetes and myocardial infarction, compared with the general population. With the expansion of the project by individuals, we could substantially reduce this epidemic in a few years!”
So how can you get involved? Join the D*action Project!
Simply complete a health questionnaire and test your vitamin D levels two times per year during the five-year program to help demonstrate the public health impact of this nutrient.
GrassrootsHealth is sponsoring the use of blood spot test kits (laboratory analysis done by ZRT Labs) for a $40 fee to each individual. The tests are to be done twice a year by each individual along with the submission of some basic health data. The fee includes:
A vitamin D blood spot test kit to be used at home (except in the state of New York)
The results are sent directly to you
You will be asked to take a quick health survey and also to take action to adjust your vitamin D levels to get into the desired ranges, ideally in consultation with a knowledgeable health care professional.
If you are a physician, medical institution or other health group, please also get involved by contacting Baggerly directly at: carole@grassrootshealth.org. Baggerly was also instrumental in getting Canada to investigate the use of vitamin D against the swine flu.
The information you provide in the health survey will then be used in a five-year study to evaluate the results of the program in disease prevention, and to help create a long-term plan for public health.
This project depends on a true “grassroots” health movement. Together we can stop the vitamin D deficiency epidemic in its tracks and improve the health of millions of people.
With only 100 of you joining today, and getting two friends to join in two weeks (and those two friends getting two more), by week 42 there could be 400,000,000 people who are vitamin D “replete” (more than the United States population)!
To find out more about vitamin D, please watch my one-hour, free vitamin D lecture.
Then, do your part to end vitamin D deficiency and improve your own health by joining the D*Action Project, and encouraging your friends and family to do the same!"

The new report is an update of previous research, adding results of 81 new studies to the findings of more than 800 that have followed women in the United States and around the world to see who develops breast cancer and who doesn't.

The study provides good news for women in the form of steps they can take to protect themselves, such as:
Be as lean as possible without being underweight. A healthy body mass index is defined as being above 18.5 but no greater than 25. Women closer to the lower end of the healthy weight range have the most protection from breast cancer.
Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. If you can't do that, at least do some. Some activity is better than none, but the more, the better.
Limit alcohol consumption. If you drink at all, limit your intake to one serving a day.
Breast-feed. New mothers should breast-feed exclusively for up to six months -- the evidence is convincing that mothers who breast-feed reduce their risk for breast cancer.
Further, increased screenings may not be the best option for women, and men.
Separate studies suggest that some cancer tests can result in false positives. Two studies -- one looking at prostate cancer and the other at breast cancer -- show that increased screening brings false positives and the costs of emotional anguish and sometimes unnecessary treatment.
While the prostate cancer study and the breast cancer study looked at two different cancers in two different populations, both studies came to similar conclusions; a lot of patients are receiving unnecessary treatments.
In the breast cancer screening study, women were given a clinical breast exam in addition to mammography. For every additional cancer found there were 55 false positives. According to the prostate cancer study's authors, between the years 1986 and 2005, 1 million men were incorrectly diagnosed with prostate cancer."

The conclusion states that: “Findings suggest that U.S. male neonates vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine had a 3-fold greater risk of ASD.”
The authors also noted that an earlier study by them found that hepatitis B vaccination was associated with receipt of early intervention and special education services.

The new study used a different database than their earlier study, and they found same results, suggesting a validation of their findings."

In his article published on LewRockwell.com, Bill Sardi details 18 reasons why you should not vaccinate your children against the flu this season. Here are nine of them:

The swine flu is simply another flu. It is not unusually deadly.
This is the first time both seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines will be administered. Both seasonal flu and swine flu vaccines will require two inoculations. This is because single inoculations have failed to produce sufficient antibodies. This is an admission that prior flu vaccines were virtually useless. Can you trust them this time?
Adjuvants are added to vaccines to boost production of antibodies but may trigger autoimmune reactions. Some adjuvants are mercury (thimerosal), aluminum and squalene. Why would you sign a consent form for your children to be injected with mercury, which is even more brain-toxic than lead?
This is the first year mock vaccines have been used to gain FDA approval. The vaccines that have been tested are not the same vaccines your children will be given.
Over-vaccination is a common practice now in America. American children are subjected to 29 vaccines by the age of two. Meanwhile, veterinarians have backed off of repeat vaccination in dogs because of observed side effects.
Modern medicine has no explanation for autism, despite its continued rise in prevalence.
Researchers are warning that over-use of the flu vaccine and anti-flu drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can apply genetic pressure on flu viruses and then they are more likely to mutate into a more deadly strain.
Most seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus strains tested from the United States and other countries are now resistant to Tamiflu (oseltamivir). Tamiflu has become a nearly worthless drug against seasonal flu.
Public health officials are irresponsible in their omission of any ways to strengthen immunity against the flu. No options outside of problematic vaccines and anti-flu drugs are offered, despite the fact there is strong evidence that vitamins C and D activate the immune system and the trace mineral selenium prevents the worst form of the disease.
For even more reasons -- 18 in all -- please review the full article on LewRockwell.com."

They get smaller, which decreases strength and increases the likelihood of falls and fractures. New research is showing how this happens, and what to do about it.
Researchers have already shown that when older people eat, they cannot make muscle as fast as the young. Now they've found that the suppression of muscle breakdown is blunted with age. This may explain the ongoing loss of muscle in older people -- when they eat they don't build enough muscle, and in addition, their insulin fails to shut down the muscle breakdown that rises between meals and overnight.
However, weight training may ""rejuvenate"" muscle blood flow and help retain muscle for older people."

Drug Company Now Claims Statins Recommended for Swine Flu","Drug companies are now claiming that cholesterol-lowering statin drugs like Lipitor and Zocor can be used as a treatment for swine flu.
A large study found that people who were taking these drugs when they caught seasonal flu and had to be hospitalized were twice as likely to survive than those who were not on such medicines.
The study involved 2,800 people hospitalized with lab-confirmed seasonal flu in 10 states in 2007-2008.
Medical records show that 801 received statins in the hospital. They probably were just continuing the cholesterol treatment they had been taking before catching the flu, though researchers don't know this for sure.
More than 3 percent of those not taking statins died in the hospital or in the following month. The rate was half that among statin users, even though they were more likely to have underlying health problems like heart disease.
This doesn't prove that statins can cure flu, or that starting on them after catching the flu would help. A federal study is under way now to test that. Doctors are optimistic, because previous studies also found that statins may improve survival from infectious diseases."

Statements by more than a dozen lawmakers were ghostwritten, in whole or in part, by Washington lobbyists working for Genentech, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies.
E-mail messages obtained by The New York Times show that the lobbyists drafted one statement for Democrats and another for Republicans.
The lobbyists, employed by Genentech and by two Washington law firms, were remarkably successful in getting the statements printed in the Congressional Record under the names of different members of Congress.
The apparent goal was to show that, even though there were sharp divisions between the parties on the overall reform bill (only one Republican voted for it), there was bipartisan support for provisions relating to drugs produced by the biotechnology industry. One provision, for example, would allow generic competition to expensive biological drugs but only after the original manufacturer had enjoyed 12 years of exclusive use, a generous period by anyone’s standards.

Try Vitamin D","Writing in the journal Clinical Endocrinology, scientists from the Netherlands, Austria, and the U.S. report that low blood levels of the sunshine vitamin are associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, and mortality from heart disease, in the elderly.
The research follows hot on the heels of similar findings published in Nutrition Research and in the Archives of Internal Medicine.
The new study used data from 614 people participating in the Hoorn Study, a prospective population-based study with men and women with an average age of 69.8. Blood levels of 25(OH)D were measured at the start of the study. After an average of six years of follow-up, 51 deaths had been documented, 20 of which were due to cardiovascular health.
People with the lowest average vitamin D levels were found to be at a 124 and 378 percent increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, respectively.
Commenting on the potential mechanism, the researchers note:
""Apart from the maintenance of muscular and skeletal health, vitamin D may also protect against cancer, infections, autoimmune and vascular diseases, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency might contribute to a reduced life expectancy.""
Adults with lower blood levels of vitamin D may also be more likely to die from heart disease or stroke. Scientists in Finland compared blood levels of vitamin D, and deaths from heart disease or stroke over time in more than 6,000 people. Those with the lowest vitamin D levels had a 25 percent higher risk of dying from heart disease or stroke.
In addition, in a study of 166 women undergoing treatment for breast cancer, nearly 70 percent had low levels of vitamin D in their blood, according to a study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Breast Cancer Symposium. The analysis showed women with late-stage disease and non-Caucasian women had even lower levels.
Said Luke Peppone, Ph.D., research assistant professor of Radiation Oncology, at Rochester's James P. Wilmot Cancer Center:
""Vitamin D is essential to maintaining bone health and women with breast cancer have accelerated bone loss due to the nature of hormone therapy and chemotherapy. It's important for women and their doctors to work together to boost their vitamin D intake."""

In an article appearing in the November 2009 print issue of the FASEB Journal, they show that antioxidants -- the same substances found in plant-based foods -- might hold the key in preventing the flu virus from wreaking havoc on our lungs.
""The recent outbreak of H1N1 influenza and the rapid spread of this strain across the world highlights the need to better understand how this virus damages the lungs and to find new treatments,"" said Sadis Matalon, co-author of the study.
""Additionally, our research shows that antioxidants may prove beneficial in the treatment of flu.""
Here's yet another indication that conventional medicine simply does not have it all figured out, and that vaccines are not the sole solution to influenza epidemics.
I've already posted numerous articles about the benefits of vitamin D and C to combat the flu, and this latest research adds to my previous recommendations for proper diet and sunshine exposure, especially prior to- and during flu season.
Why You Need Antioxidants
It is generally recognized that antioxidants are powerful nutrients that protect your health by fighting against free radicals in your body, preventing damage from oxidation.
Free radicals are highly reactive molecules, typically some oxygen derivative in human systems, with unpaired electrons. These unpaired electrons cause them to be highly reactive and can damage your DNA and other important tissues of your body.
As this free-radical damage continues, cells can no longer perform properly, and hence, tissues begin to degrade and disease sets in.
In this study, the researchers found that the flu virus damages your lungs through a protein called M2, which attacks the cells that line the inner surface of your lungs (epithelial cells). They discovered that the M2 protein disrupts your epithelial cells' ability to remove liquid from inside of your lungs, which can lead to pneumonia and other lung problems. However, antioxidants were able to prevent the M2 protein from damaging the epithelial cells.
Now, in this study they actually used antioxidant-like drugs to stop the destruction of epithelial cells, however, it offers an intriguing glimpse into how dietary antioxidants probably work naturally.
As I've mentioned several times before, the vast majority of flu deaths are actually caused by such secondary infections such as pneumonia, and your diet has a lot to do with how well your body can combat this disease process as well.
Highest Ranking Antioxidant Food Sources
Ideally, you'll want to get your antioxidants from your food. Your next best bet is from whole food supplements.
Excellent food sources of antioxidants include:
Fruits: Cranberries, blueberries and blackberries
Vegetables: Beans, artichokes
Nuts: Pecans, walnuts and hazelnuts
Spices: Ground cloves, ground cinnamon and oregano
Vitamin C – Potent Antioxidant Already Shown to Be Effective Against Flu
Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant, and as you may recall, I recently published a case study from Dr. Thomas Levy, where intravenous vitamin C was used to save the life of a man with swine flu.
In one of his articles, Dr. Levy describes the mechanics of vitamin C, and how it works to treat infectious diseases such as the flu.
In addition, the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service has published findings showing that vitamin C is effective against a broad range of viral infections, including bird flu:
""High dose vitamin C is a remarkably safe and effective treatment for viral infections. In high doses, vitamin C neutralizes free radicals, helps kill viruses, and strengthens your body's immune system.
Taking supplemental vitamin C routinely helps prevent viral infections.
The Avian Flu (or Bird Flu), so often mentioned by newspapers, magazines and other news sources, is a particularly severe form of influenza.
Interestingly, the symptoms of avian flu include hemorrhages under the skin, and bleeding from the nose and gums. These are also classical symptoms of clinical scurvy, which means a critical vitamin C deficiency is present. This means that vitamin C (ascorbate) is needed to treat it.
Severe cases may require 200,000 to 300,000 milligrams of vitamin C or more, given intravenously (IV) by a physician.
This very high dosing may be needed since the Avian Flu appears to consume vitamin C very rapidly, similar to an acute viral hemorrhagic fever, somewhat like an Ebola infection.""
They even stated that vitamin C, at saturation, can replace antiviral drugs.
Here are three other sources discussing the remarkable benefits of vitamin C for infectious diseases such as the flu:
Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics, 1999 found that vitamin C in megadoses administered before or after the appearance of cold and flu symptoms relieved and prevented the symptoms in the test population compared with the control group.
The Clinical Experiences of Frederick R. Klenner, MD states that cases of influenza, encephalitis, and measles were easily cured with vitamin C injections and oral doses.
Orthomed.com – Dr. Robert Cathcart, MD, also offers personal case studies where intravenous administration of vitamin C turned out to be lifesaving in cases of acute flu complications.
""It is not really a matter of medicine; it is a matter of chemistry. Doses of ascorbate which are massive enough to force a reducing redox potential into tissues affected by the disease will always neutralize the free radicals,"" he says.
A Word of Caution about Vitamin C Supplements
It's important to remember that every nutrient you ingest raises or lowers up to nine other nutrients in your body. For example, taking large doses of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) on a regular basis lowers your level of copper, so if you are already deficient in copper and take high doses of vitamin C, you can compromise your immune system.
So, whereas temporarily taking megadoses of vitamin C supplements to combat a case of the cold or flu is likely not going to cause a problem, for long-term, daily use, your best bet is to eat a diet that is full of high quality organic vegetables and fruits that are minimally processed. Not only will you get vitamin C, but you will get all the other accessory nutrients and micronutrients that are needed to optimize vitamin C and all of its beneficial functions.
Influenza May Be a Sign of Vitamin D Deficiency
There is compelling evidence showing that flu may in fact be a sign of vitamin D deficiency.
In addition to scientific studies on vitamin D levels and the seasonality of the flu, an analysis of CDC data indicates that vitamin D deficient children are also at higher risk of death from the flu.
The data shows that almost two-thirds of 36 children who died from H1N1 had epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or other neurodevelopmental conditions like mental retardation.
All of these neurological conditions are associated with childhood Vitamin D deficiency. Exacerbating the problem further, many of these kids take anticonvulsant drugs, which also lower vitamin D levels.
  Vitamin D may very well be one of the most beneficial vitamins there is for disease prevention, including the flu. Unfortunately it's also one of the vitamins that a vast majority of people across the world are deficient in due to lack of regular exposure to sunshine.
Part of the explanation lies in the fact that vitamin D, which forms when your skin is exposed to sunlight, regulates the expression of more than 2,000 genes throughout your body, including ones that influence your immune system to attack and destroy bacteria and viruses.
Hence, being overwhelmed by the ""flu bug"" could signal that your vitamin D levels are too low, allowing the flu virus to overtake your immune system.
In addition, a number of studies show that the higher your vitamin D level, the lower your risk of contracting colds, flu, and other respiratory tract infections in general. For example:
A 2007 study suggests higher vitamin D status enhances your immunity to microbial infections. They found that subjects with vitamin D deficiency had significantly more days of absence from work due to respiratory infection than did control subjects.
A 2009 study on vitamin D deficiency in newborns with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) confirmed a strong, positive correlation between newborns and mothers' vitamin D levels. Newborns with vitamin D deficiency appear to have an increased risk of developing ALRI, and since the child's vitamin D level strongly correlates with its mother's, the researchers recommend that all mothers optimize their vitamin D levels during pregnancy, especially in the winter months, to safeguard their babie's health.
A similar Indian study published in 2004 also reported that vitamin D deficiency in infants significantly raised their odds ratio for having severe ALRI.
The 2009 analysis of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which included 19,000 subjects over the age of 12, also found that higher vitamin D levels equated to lowered incidence of upper respiratory infections (URI).The correlation between lower vitamin D levels and increased risk of URI's was even stronger in individuals with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Another 2009 report in the journal Pediatric Research stated that infants and children appear more susceptible to viral rather than bacterial infections when deficient in vitamin D. And that, based on the available evidence showing a strong connection between vitamin D, infections, and immune function in children, vitamin D supplementation may be a valuable therapy in pediatric medicine.
Vitamin D Dose Recommendations
Based on the most recent research, the current recommendation is 35 IU's of vitamin D per pound of body weight.
So for a child weighing 40 pounds, the recommended average dose would be 1,400 IU's daily, and for a 170-pound adult, the dose would be nearly 6,000 IU's. The chart below will give you general approximations for what the recommended daily dose might be for children, young adults, and pregnant women.
Vitamin D Dose Recommendations
Age Dosage
Below 5 35 units per pound per day
Age 5 - 10 2500 units
Age 18 - 30 5000 units
Pregnant Women 5000 units
WARNING:
There is no way to know if the above recommendations are correct. The ONLY way to know is to test your blood. You might need 4-5 times the amount recommended above. Ideally your blood level of 25 OH D should be 60ng/ml.
  However, it's important to realize that vitamin D requirements are highly individual, as your vitamin D status is dependent on numerous factors, such as the color of your skin, where you live, and how much sunshine you're exposed to on a regular basis.
So, although these recommendations may put you closer to the ballpark of what most people likely need, it is simply impossible to make a blanket recommendation that will cover everyone's needs.
The ONLY way to determine the correct dose is to get your blood tested since there are so many variables that influence your vitamin D status. I recommend using Lab Corp in the U.S. 
Ideally, you'll want your vitamin D level to be between 50-65 ng/ml, year-round. In Canada and Europe, your test results may come back in ml/L. To convert ml/L to ng/ml, simply divide your result by 2.5.
For more details on vitamin D dosing, optimal vitamin D levels, and testing, please see this previous article."

The Difference Between What You Learn in School and What Works
Dr. Palevsky says:
“When I went through medical school, I was taught that vaccines were completely safe and completely effective, and I had no reason to believe otherwise. All the information that I was taught was pretty standard in all the medical schools and the teachings and scientific literature throughout the country. I had no reason to disbelieve it.
Over the years, I kept practicing medicine and using vaccines and thinking that my approach to vaccines was completely onboard with everything else I was taught.
But more and more, I kept seeing that my experience of the world, my experience in using and reading about vaccines, and hearing what parents were saying about vaccines were very different from what I was taught in medical school and my residency training.
… and it became clearer to me as I read the research, listened to more and more parents, and found other practitioners who also shared the same concern that vaccines had not been completely proven safe or even completely effective, based on the literature that we have today.
… It didn’t appear that the scientific studies that we were given were actually appropriately designed to prove and test the safety and efficacy.

It also came to my attention that there were ingredients in there that were not properly tested, that the comparison groups were not appropriately set up, and that conclusions made about vaccine safety and efficacy just did not fit the scientific standards that I was trained to uphold in my medical school training.”
Were Vaccines Really the ‘Savior’ Against Past Diseases?
Conventional medicine teaches that the polio and the smallpox epidemics went away because of the vaccines, and that most of the diseases that we faced in the 20th century in the United States were brought down because of the power, strength and the implementation of the vaccine policy.
Meanwhile, there are a significant number of studies in the medical literature that actually show there were many other reasons that these infectious diseases went away.
For example, one article published in 2000 in the Pediatrics Journal describes how, before the World War II, the majority of the infectious diseases the US was faced with – such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, measles, influenza, parapertussis, tuberculosis and scarlet fever – were all reduced before World War II and BEFORE there were antibiotics and vaccinations available to treat or to vaccinate against these diseases.
The reasons for the reductions in incidence rates and mortality of these diseases were predominantly due to the implementation of public health strategies, including:
Clean water
Better living conditions
Improved sanitation
Improved nutrition
There are many such examples.
Have the Proper Safety Studies Actually Been Done?
So, why is there such a vast difference among intelligent, scientifically oriented, committed and objective scientists and physicians about the safety and efficacy of vaccines? Dr. Palevsky says:
“I think that if you ask most of my colleagues where they get their information, they will say that they read it from the American Academy of Pediatrics, from the AMA, from the CDC, and in their journals. But I would like to challenge most of my colleagues to look through the studies themselves to actually see if the proper scientific studies were done using a proper study group and a proper control group.Were the ingredients in vaccines properly studied?
Is there a difference between being exposed to a virus, bacteria, heavy metal or toxin through the air, food, your intestines and your skin, versus when it’s injected into your body?Have we really looked at what happens to vaccine materials once injected into a child? Is an antibody sufficient to provide protection for a child against disease? More and more studies are coming out to show that:
The proper studies haven’t been done
Antibodies are not the final way in which your body is protected
There is a difference between how children process material through air and food versus through injection
There are particles in vaccines that do accumulate in your body and cause impairments in your immune system
There are particles in the vaccines that get into your brain, and
There are foreign DNA particles that get into your body
For many health professionals it is a shock to discover that there is such a lack of information on the safety and efficacy, and a mounting degree of information that actually raises suspicions about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and whether or not they have been properly studied.”
What we currently have is a one-sided policy; a one way of thinking that is impossible to really allow for the appropriate debate. Science is truly a field where you ask a question, you find an answer, and you don’t have the biases or the influences that change the way an answer or a conclusion is made. We are not seeing that with vaccines.
On a personal note, I recently received the Visionary Award at the NVIC conference in Washington DC. In my acceptance speech, I basically broke down in tears when I told the audience how I felt when I came to realize that by routinely vaccinating thousands of innocent children at my clinic, I’d probably caused damage to many of them. It was a very difficult thing for me to accept intellectually and emotionally.
How a Conventionally Trained Physician Accepts that Vaccines Can Cause Harm
Dr. Palevsky began his investigation in earnest about 10 years ago because parents came to him with complaints, worries, and concerns that something had happened to their children after they were vaccinated. Interestingly, this is the same way that I became enlightened about vaccines -- through the concern of a very patient mother whose family I was taking care of. She gently persisted in showing me the evidence and thank God I listened!
Tragically, most doctors are far too arrogant to even consider that there is any possibility that there might be something wrong with vaccines. Most pediatricians are indoctrinated to simply tell parents that anything related to a bad outcome from a vaccine is a mere coincidence. But how come there are so many of these “coincidences”?Says Palevsky,
“It is heartbreaking, because I see many of these kids who were developmentally normal, who were doing well, who were speaking, then whose voices and eye contacts were lost, who went into seizures, who developed asthma and allergies, and they had nowhere to go because their doctors told them that they don’t know what they’re talking about. These kids are real.
The literature is showing that there are changes in the immune system of children who are vaccinated, especially if we vaccinate them before one year of age or even at one day of age. The literature is there. It’s good scientific literature, and it shows that more and more of these kids who are suffering from chronic illness are suffering from impairments of their immune system. Whether vaccines are causative or contributory, the literature is showing that there is a role that vaccines are playing in creating the groundwork for these children’s immune systems to start to show signs of impairment and destruction.
… When I look at the studies that the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC put out, saying that there’s no correlation between vaccination and autism or vaccinations and asthma, I have to say that the studies just don’t hold up to the scientific standards.
You can’t have 25 children in a study and then report that this proves that no children who get autism have any correlation to being injured by vaccines. This is what the media does: they take these conclusions, put it right out in front of the newspapers and say, “Vaccines don’t cause autism.” When you really look at the studies – and there’s not a proper control group and there’s only 25 people – you can’t make a grand, generalized statement about a general population because you’ve studied 25 children.”
The NVIC Set to Create Groundbreaking Vaccine Safety Research
The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) just raised $100,000 and continues to look for donations and sponsors to allow proper safety studies to be done by independent researchers, who aren’t going to influence the outcomes. One study that looked at the health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children does exist. Published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in April 2005, that looked at the health outcomes of children who are fully vaccinated, who are partially vaccinated, and who are not vaccinated at all.
All the investigators asked the parents to do was to report atopic illness. Atopic illness means allergies, asthma, eczema, hay fever. The investigators were blinded, meaning they didn’t know which category the participants belonged to.
When they assessed the data, they found that the largest number of reports by parents of children with atopic illness were in the kids who were fully vaccinated. The second highest reports were in the families who are partially vaccinated. And the lowest number of reports was in the children who were unvaccinated…
The investigators performed a statistical analysis to see if the data was based on chance or on real statistical differences, and found there were statistically significant differences between these groups. They couldn’t understand how this was possible, because the generally accepted consensus is that vaccines are completely safe, and completely effective.
Based on this initial finding, we clearly need to do follow-up studies to ask the same question over and over again; repeat this kind of investigation with different populations across different parts of the country, to unearth the truth! Dr. Palevsky says:
“Certainly, the issue has been raised about the special interests, the money that’s tied, the policies, how much money the vaccine manufacturers stand to make, the doctors who make decisions on vaccines, and how much money they stand to make. But we need the science and not this conspiracy theory... If we just stay with the science, and really start to address the need for the science, and look at the fact that there is a lack of science, we will definitely see that more needs to be done. We have not done due diligence.”
Are Some Vaccines Safer Than Others?
Many may be surprised by Dr. Palevsky’s answer: “… in my research of the vaccines, and of the basic microbiology and virology that we’re trained to know in our medical training, I cannot understand how a vaccine with a virus can be safe.” What most people don’t know is that a virus is not “alive,” per se. It is simply a piece or strand of either RNA or DNA. And even of itself, a virus can’t “do” anything.
In addition it is so tiny that it can only be seen under an electron microscope. It is much smaller than bacteria, which can only be seen in the regular microscope. So viruses cannot be isolated when you make a viral vaccine. All that can be isolated is the tissue, whether it’s human tissue or animal tissue that is believed to have been infected by that specific virus that you’re trying to isolate.
So when a viral culture or a set of cultures are made including the specific virus, you’re going to have the DNA of people or animals who were already infected. Those cells are then taken and grown on animal cells, whether it's monkey kidney cells or chicken embryo cells. When mixed together, these cells will splice and recombine, which means that DNA from animal cells are going to mix with DNA from the known infected cells with the virus.
So by definition, a viral vaccine contains foreign animal and, even possibly, foreign human DNA. That’s why if you have an egg allergy, you shouldn’t get certain vaccines because it is known that there’s going to be egg protein in the vaccine. So the question is, how safe is it to inject viral material that is embedded into the DNA of foreign DNA cells? What studies have been done to actually test whether foreign DNA is getting into your body; whether it stays in your DNA; whether it gets into your brain; and whether there are foreign animal viruses that are inherently present in animal DNA to begin with?
The Dangers of Adjuvants
Adjuvants are used in vaccines in order to create a sufficiently strong immunological response. Adjuvants augment your immunological response. But there is clear evidence that adjuvants, like aluminum and squalene impair your immune system. So while you may be getting the antibodies desired, you are, at the same time, damaging your immune system. Particularly in children, this can set them up to develop chronic illness.
Pushing for Informed Consent
So, does that mean you should never vaccinate against anything? Dr. Palevsky says:
“That’s something that needs to be left up to the individual parent. I am truly a proponent of informed consent, and I’m truly supportive of families who have done their homework and who have been able to make the choice. What is the possible risk of the illness? What is the possible health outcome if your child gets one of those illnesses?
And how much do you know about those risks versus how much do you know about the risks of the vaccines and the health outcomes of what may happen when children are vaccinated against single, or even multiple, vaccines? And when parents are given both sides, it is up to them to make that informed choice.
It is no longer my role to tell them that they must do this vaccine but not that vaccine, because each parent has to make an informed choice based on their understanding of how diseases occur or don’t occur, what science we have available, and whether they feel comfortable with the devil that they know (the science and the outcomes of disease) versus the devil that they don’t know (science and the outcomes of the vaccine).”
What about the Swine Flu Vaccine?
Echoing many other health professionals, including myself, Dr. Palevsky’s concern is that there haven’t been sufficient amounts of scientific investigation to actually be able to say that the vaccines are safe, or even effective. He says:
“Now if you read the packaging first of the swine flu vaccine, it specifically states that the swine flu or the H1N1 flu vaccine was manufactured in the same manufacturing process as the flu vaccine. Therefore since we believe that the flu vaccine has been sufficiently tested to be safe, we can then conclude that the H1N1 vaccine is safe.
But the public should know that even though our authorities are standing there and saying that the H1N1 vaccine is safe, the proper studies have not been done. … And it’s unfair to say to parents or to the public that if you come down with a flu-like illness, it must be H1N1. In studies that have been done, people who did get the flu had their noses swabbed, and they were found to have H1N1.
What’s missing in these data is a population of healthy people who have not had any flu symptoms – to actually see if their noses contained H1N1 – because if someone is sick and has the presence of an H1N1 virus in the nose, it doesn’t mean that the H1N1 is causing the illness.
You really have to take an appropriate control group to see if people are colonized with that virus even when they’re not sick. So we don’t have that data; we really don’t know. I don’t think we can say with good scientific certainty that people who are getting sick from the flu and who are being diagnosed with H1N1 are actually having H1N1 as the cause.”
Other Ways to Protect Yourself Against the Flu
Again, there’s clear evidence in the medical literature that shows proper hygiene, proper sleep, proper diet, proper supplementation with things like vitamin D (making sure that you get your vitamin D level done first), and perhaps vitamin C, can actually prevent you from getting the flu. Many insist that vaccinated individuals “protect” the unvaccinated against the flu virus – in essence, reaping the benefit of the protection they refuse for themselves, while at the same time putting others in danger. But how does that make sense? Says Dr. Palevsky: “How does vaccinating against the flu virus stop you from carrying the flu virus in your nasal passages?” And yet, this is what many believe.
The Concept of Herd Immunity – BUSTED!
One of the primary arguments that is being used to justify this insane behavior is “herd immunity.”The fact is that vaccination does NOT stop you from carrying bacteria or viruses in your nose, in your throat, in your intestines, in your airway, on your skin, or in your body. But many do not understand the significance of this fact, and have been made to believe that if you’re vaccinated, you won’t carry viruses, and therefore, others will be protected because you’re vaccinated. As it turns out, this belief is NOT based on scientific fact. Dr. Palevsky explains:
“This whole concept of herd immunity is very interesting, because we were taught that herd immunity occurs because a certain percentage of a population gets an active illness. Therefore by a certain percentage of getting the active illness, they impart a protection onto the remaining part of the population that has not gotten the illness yet. And so the herd that is getting the illness is shedding the illness and protecting those who have not gotten it.
In vaccine science, we are extrapolating or concluding that if we vaccinate a certain percentage of people, we are imparting protection on those who have not been vaccinated. And that has NOT been shown to be true, because the true herd immunity in theory is based on an ACTIVE DISEASE, and we know that despite what we’re taught, vaccination does not mimic the natural disease.
So we cannot use the same model of herd immunity in a natural disease in the vaccination policy. But unfortunately, we do use it even though it cannot be used because it doesn’t have scientific backing. What’s most interesting to me is that the entire concept of herd immunity fails to acknowledge that there is a life cycle of the viruses and the bacteria all on their own, and that what turns them on and off may have nothing to do with the percentage of people who have been infected.
All you have to do is look at the SARS outbreak. That virus that we were supposed to fear didn’t infect 70 or 80 percent of the population, which would then impart herd immunity on the 20 or 30 percent that didn’t get the disease.
This is because the virus itself had a life cycle of its own. And so it came and went without any percentage of the population being protected. There wasn’t herd immunity, and yet the virus died out on its own.
We fail to include that viruses have a life cycle, and that they are in relationship to other organisms and to us. Something activates them and something actually stops them, and it has nothing necessarily to do with the percentage of people who would have the illness or who have been vaccinated.
… It is preposterous to think that a child who is vaccinated no longer carries the bacteria or the viruses that they have been vaccinated against. If, in fact, children are vaccinated, then why are parents and public health authorities afraid that non-vaccinated children are somehow carrying something that their children are not, when they should feel comfortable that their children are vaccinated? You can’t have it both ways.
You can’t vaccinate believing that your children are protected and then feel that your children are not protected because somehow, some non-vaccinated child is carrying some secret organism that no one else is carrying. It just doesn’t make any sense.”
The Difference between Natural Immunity and Vaccine-lnduced Immunity
It’s important to understand that the natural illness has greater influence on the health of your body. Says Dr. Palevsky: “In medical school, the mentors that I had saw children in their practices in the 40s, 50s and all the way up to the 80s getting these flu-like illnesses who were properly treated with rest, fluids and proper supplementation.  Those kids had developmental growth spurts after the illnesses were over. There is something to say for these viral illnesses that impart a certain boosting of the immune system of your children. And if we’re not letting them have these illnesses, what are we doing to their immune systems? Aren’t we actually hampering their overall health?”
You need to understand that there’s a significant difference between natural immunity and vaccination immunity. When children are born, they develop natural immunity to hundreds, thousands, millions, and even trillions of microorganisms that they breathe in, eat, and touch through their skin. Their immune systems at the lining of their airways, at the lining of their intestines, and on their skin are actively protecting their body from the outside world.
Those immune systems that are intricately and specifically located in the linings are very important to create memory and protection to the organisms that they continue to breathe, eat, and touch. That immune system response then has a domino effect on creating other memory and immune responses that give your body antibodies and protection. That’s a very important step for how the immune system matures in our children. From the linings, the immune system receives information, sends out signals to all other parts of the immune system, and creates an immune response, memory, and antibodies.
On the other hand, when you inject materials into your body, you are bypassing that crucial first step called the primary line of defense. With vaccination you are just creating an antibody. That does NOT impart long-term immunity because it does not create the kind of memory that occurs when you breathe it in, eat it, or are exposed through the skin, and then go through the course of the natural disease. Some people will argue that this is why we have nasal spray vaccines. However, again, you’re making the assumption that you have not already been exposed to the virus at some point, and you’re also making the assumption that exposure automatically leads to infection. Exposure does not necessarily lead to infection. A lot of it has to do with the overall status of your immune system.
The Dangers of Combining Vaccines
One issue that is frequently ignored is the potential harm from the synergy of combinations of vaccines, which have never been studied. No one knows whether there’s interaction between the bacteria and the viruses in the vaccines administered as part of the childhood vaccination schedule, or if there is interaction in the trace thimerosal (which is still in some of the multi-vials of certain vaccines), or the large amount of aluminum that is in many of them. Dr. Palevsky says:
“There is a scientist named Boyd Haley, who has actually looked into some of the vaccine ingredients and (1) what happens to nerve cells when you inject them in the lab to specific vaccine ingredients, and (2) what happens to the nerve cells when you keep adding another vaccine ingredient.
He specifically showed that in the presence of thimerosal, there’s a lot of damage to nerve cells. When you add aluminum to the thimerosal, you need less thimerosal to create the damage to the immune and nerve cells in the presence of aluminum. Then when you add neomycin – an antibiotic in some of the vaccines – it potentiates the potency of nerve cell damage with aluminum and mercury together.
And when you culture the nerve cells and testosterone, versus estrogen, and you expose them to some of the vaccine ingredients like thimerosal, you actually see that the nerve cells that are exposed to testosterone are more damaged in greater amounts than the nerve cells that are bathed in estrogen. That raises some concern because we do see that children with neurodevelopmental disorders are 4:1, boys to girls. So you have to question whether testosterone actually makes children more vulnerable to exposure to toxins like mercury, aluminum or their combination?
None of these studies have been done in humans. People say, “We can’t do those studies.” And I say, “Why not?” They say, “It’s unethical.” I say, “Well, if it’s unethical to do those studies on vaccine ingredients and combining them together, then it’s unethical to give the vaccines in general.” So we’re missing a lot of important data that we won’t believe, and we’re also missing a lot of important data that we won’t accumulate because most of the studies that are done are by the manufacturers of the vaccines themselves.”

Breakfast and exercise are two of your most important health strategies. But it may surprise you to find out that exercising in the morning has special benefits. A large number of studies have actually been done on this aspect of exercise, and it turns out that the best time, for most people to exercise, is during the morning hours.
Why Exercising in the Morning is Best
What these studies found was that compliance, in other words, your ability to persistently maintain your exercise regimen, on a regular basis, increases when you exercise in the morning.
When you schedule your exercise later in the day, invariably you will have something competing for that time, and you're likely to miss it.
In addition, exercising at night has another disadvantage.
Exercise tends to rev up your system at a time when you're better off relaxing and preparing for bed. So, you really want to avoid exercising aggressively later in the evening.
I would strongly recommend you exercise in the morning if at all possible as it will radically increase your compliance to this crucial activity. You probably already know this, but let me repeat it, you simply will never achieve optimal health if you aren't exercising.
If you're able to do that, then I would also recommend you delay your breakfast untilafter you're done exercising.
Don't You Want to Feel This Good?
This past weekend I was in southern Florida with my executive team on a planning retreat and I had a chance to run on some white sand beaches. During my run I was reflecting on just how wonderful it is to be fit. It makes all the difference in the world to be fit, strong, flexible, and pain free. To have ALL the energy you need to do anything you want to in life.
Guess I was just so HIGHLY appreciative that pioneers in natural medicine were able to outline these principles so I could learn and apply them. I really feel I am reaping the rewards as I feel better than I have my entire life.
And it really isn't that hard. Once you feel as good as I do, you NEVER want to lose that feeling and it becomes very easy to maintain your exercise program and keep it going strong. It is one of the BEST investments you could ever make in your life.
For a mere few hours a week of minor discomfort, you get over 25 times as much time feeling great. Pretty good deal if you ask me. I am also sure you realize that NO ONE can delegate this out. You simply have to do it for yourself. You can hire a chef and house cleaner but ultimately you are the only one that can get yourself in shape.
Just remember you need a BALANCED exercise program. Just jumping on a treadmill at your gym will NOT produce this level of fitness. You need to add good flexibility training like yoga, great core training like Pilates, strength training, and anaerobic speed work. Once you combine ALL of these types of exercises, you will have the fitness that you truly deserve.  The comprehensive approach also radically reduces your risk of injury, which is common with many who only use one type of exercise to achieve fitness.
What Do You Eat for Breakfast?
OK, time to progress from exercise to breakfast.
Unfortunately, breakfast, at least in the United States, and I'm sure in many other countries in the world, is literally one of the worst meals to eat out. Almost every restaurant or hotel offers breakfast choices that typically do not create good health. Why?  Because typically, what you'll find is an assortment of pancakes, waffles, toast or even donuts, along with cereal or scrambled eggs.
These are not necessarily healthy foods, no matter what kind of health claims may be promoted on the box. Finding a healthy breakfast option when eating out is such a challenge, you're far better off preparing your own meal. It reminds me of an important principle:
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.  This principle works equally well with respect to your food choices.
So, before you go to bed at night, it is always good to have a plan for what you're going to eat the following day – for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
This way, you have the opportunity to get the wheels turning and get that food prepared and ready for when you wake up. So, if you choose to do your exercise in the morning, what are you going to eat afterwards?
What Makes for a Healthy Breakfast?
It has literally taken me decades to refine this formula, and I believe many of you would benefit from this information.
So exactly what is my breakfast formula?
Well, primarily because of the exercise – as I mentioned above, I do many intense exercises, including cardio, strength training, core training, active resistance, flexibility stretching on a Power Plate, and anaerobic burst interval-type exercises – so there's intense pressure on my muscles. They need to recover, which means I need plenty of protein – anyone will need a lot of protein to recover, repair, and rebuild muscles.
So you'll want to make sure you have high quality protein for breakfast after you've exercised.
One of the sources I've found to be the best is a high quality whey protein, specifically from grass-fed, non-hormonally treated cows, that is minimally processed. This ensures it has contains beneficial immuno components, including immunoglobins, bovine serum albomin, and lactoferins, in addition to all the key amino acids and other beneficial nutrients you typically get from a high quality whey protein.
We created this product, called Miracle Whey, and recently introduced a number of new flavors that are just phenomenal. Most whey products are processed with heat and acid, and are often artificially sweetened, which render them useless from a health perspective. That's why we use a cold processed, non-acid treated whey, naturally sweetened with Lo-Han, a non-glycemic fruit extract.
My Healthy Breakfast Recipe
I put a giant scoop of the banana Miracle Whey in a one-quart glass mason jar, and then I add two to four eggs. These are typically eggs purchased from a local farmer, not from the grocery store, so they're organic, free-range eggs.
Now, some people don't like the texture of raw eggs. But that's typically due to the stringy consistency of the egg whites. Fortunately, you won't need to worry about that here, because when you mix it up as I recommend, it is all dissolved into the mix.
I challenge anyone to be able to differentiate between a shake that has the eggs in it, and one that doesn't. You won't be able to tell the difference at all.
So I think if you try it, you'll be very pleasantly surprised.
After putting in the whey mix and the eggs, I add between one-fourth to one-third of coconut milk. Especially with the banana flavored whey, this mix imparts a heavenly flavor of coconut banana. Coconut is a great source of MCTs, which are medium chain triglycerides. MCTs are the best low glycemic fuel for your muscles after exercise. Thus, the coconut milk further enhances the fueling impact of Miracle Whey, which also contains MCTs.
My company is currently searching for a first-class supplier of coconut milk in glass containers, to avoid and all problems with BPA-laced can liners, and we hope to have that available shortly. I will definitely switch once we find a suitable supplier, but for now, I use canned organic coconut milk.
If you like, you can beef up your morning meal even further. There is fiber in our Miracle Whey, but you can increase the fiber content by adding something like organic psyllium.
I like to use the organic psyllium we have from a company called Organic India. It's really phenomenal. I use a teaspoon or two of that in the quart jar.
To top it all off, I add some seeds. I alternate between seeds that contain omega-3 fats and omega-6 fats. All the seeds are organic. For omega-3 fats, I alternate between chia seeds and flax seeds. (I grind them freshly in a coffee grinder.) For omega-6, I alternate between pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds, switching between them on a regular basis, depending on what I feel like having that day. After grinding the seeds of choice in the coffee grinder and adding them to the mix, I then fill the rest of the jar with water.
Skip Your Blender -- Use a Hand Mixer
Then I use a hand blender or hand mixer, which you can get at either Costco or Target for about $30 or so, if you don't have one already.
I strongly recommend a hand mixer for the ease of cleanup. You can rinse it clean in under five seconds. If you use a traditional blender it will take you a lot longer. We're all rushed in the morning, so that's usually the last thing you'll want to spend time on.
So, if you like banana and coconut, you're going to love this recipe. It's about the closest thing to ice cream. Best of all, it's so nourishing, and it fills me up until lunch time.
It's a really practical alternative to the challenges you face with breakfast foods in restaurants. I actually bring these ingredients with me when I travel, including fresh eggs. I get some of the strangest looks from flight attendants and TSA agents when they see me bring eggs through the security gates. Ditto for the hand mixer, which usually gets a thorough inspection.
But it's certainly worth the effort. This way I can have breakfast in my hotel room. As long as you're planning ahead, you too can eat healthy no matter where you are or what's going on.
Bottom Line
Remember, most people are unconsciously exchanging ""convenience"" for their health. You are too smart to make that mistake.
Re-read what I wrote in the ""Don't You Want to Feel This Good"" section above and you will have additional motivation to choose wisely.
Convenience foods may seem quicker and easier, but believe me, they come at a significant cost to your health, and I'm sure you don't want to pay that price down the road. Besides, whipping up this breakfast couldn't be faster or easier, or more nutritious!
Applying these strategies – exercising in the morning, and then having a healthy, protein-rich breakfast shake – are two great, easy ways for you and your family to take control of your health."

New research confirms what consumers have long known -- most breakfast cereals advertised to children are full of sugar.
Cereals marketed to kids have 85 percent more sugar, 65 percent less fiber and 60 percent more sodium than those aimed at adults. In fact, the least nutritious cereals are often the most heavily marketed to children, such as Reese's Puffs, Corn Pops, Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Cap' n Crunch.
Some cereals with the poorest ratings even have health claims on the box.
San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera has written a letter to the CEO of Kellogg's, demanding evidence that Cocoa Krispies really ""helps support your child's immunity"" as it purports to do on the front of the box.
Cocoa Krispies are 40 percent sugar by weight. A Kellogg's company spokesperson, Susanne Norwitz, argued that Kellogg's Krispies cereals provide consumers with 25 percent of their daily value of vitamins A, C, and E.
Kellogg began making the immunity claims about Cocoa Krispies in May, however as of November 4 said they're pulling the claim from the box.
Meanwhile, the average preschooler sees 642 cereal ads a year on TV. Most are for types with the worst nutrition ratings.
According to Cereal FACTS (Food Advertising to Children and Teens Score), which was developed based on the best available science, in consultation with a steering committee of experts in nutrition, marketing, and public health, the 10 worst breakfast cereals based on nutrition score are:
Kellogg - Corn Pops (or Pops) - Chocolate Peanut Butter
Quaker - Cap'n Crunch - w/ Crunchberries
Kellogg - Special K - Chocolatey Delight
Kellogg - Special K - Blueberry
General Mills - Reese's Puffs
General Mills - Fiber One - Caramel Delight
Kellogg - Cocoa Krispies - Choconilla
General Mills - Golden Grahams
General Mills - Cinnamon Toast Crunch
Kellogg - Corn Pops
How can Kellogg’s Cocoa Krispies, which is one of the 10 worst breakfast cereals out there, get away with putting a giant slogan across the front of their cereal boxes claiming this sugar-laden nutritional disaster will help support your child’s immunity?
The cereal is 40 percent sugar by weight … and sugar can suppress your immune system and impair your defenses against infectious disease.
Telling parents that they are doing their child’s health a favor by allowing them to eat this, or practically any children’s cereal, is akin to letting them sit down to a plate full of Twinkies and Oreos and calling it a balanced meal.
Fortunately, Kellogg has been receiving criticism from parent groups and nutritionists alike ever since it launched the far-fetched claim, and as of November 4 said they are pulling it from their cereal boxes.
Kellogg was criticized for playing up the cereal’s imaginary immunity benefits in response to the H1N1 flu craze, which the company denied.
Yet, rather than admitting the claim was way beyond a stretch of the truth, Kellogg has said it’s pulling the claim “given the public attention on H1N1.”
But immunity claims or not, if you really want to look out for your child, one of the first steps would be to immediately get rid of any cereal, particularly if it has a cartoon character on the box, as children’s cereals are notoriously bad for children’s health.
Children’s Cereals Are Nutritional Disasters
Breakfast cereals, which were initially developed to increase convenience, have mostly morphed into nothing more than highly processed sweetened grains sprinkled with synthetic vitamins. They are a mere fantasy of a healthy food, and I don’t recommend you eat any cereal for breakfast on a regular basis -- including those that are marketed as healthy fiber sources!
But you should know, whether you have children or you secretly keep a stash of Cap‘n Crunch in your pantry, that cereals that are aggressively marketed to kids have the worst nutritional quality of all cereals, according to an analysis of 161 brands conducted last year.
The analysis, published in the Journal of American Dietetic Association, found that children’s cereals have more sugar, sodium, carbohydrates, and calories per gram than cereals not marketed to kids. They also have less protein and fiber.
On average, sugar accounts for more than one-third of the weight of children‘s cereals compared to less than one-quarter of adult cereals.
But parents continue to shell out for these nutritional disasters because the food industry spends about $229 million annually advertising them to children. Colorful cartoons and other cheery tricks stimulate your child into wanting these “fun” foods, but the damage they can do to your child’s health is no laughing matter.
In the last two decades, the prevalence of overweight adolescents has nearly tripled, and current statistics show 16 percent of children are overweight or obese. An excess of sugar and carbohydrates are two culprits contributing to this growing problem.
Cereal is Not a Healthy Breakfast
According to the analysis of 161 cereal brands noted above, one serving of cereal equated to 11 percent of the daily limit of added sugar for active boys, aged 14 to 18 years old, and an astounding 92 percent of the daily sugar intake for sedentary girls aged 9 to 13.
The problem with feeding your child foods high in added sugar is twofold -- they contain little in terms of vitamins and minerals, and the calories they contain are not made up of important micronutrients needed for health and growth.
Reducing sugar intake should be on the top of your list regardless of whether your child is currently overweight or not, because it’s been proven over and over that sugar increases insulin levels, which can lead to:
High blood pressure and high cholesterol
Heart disease
Diabetes
Weight gain
Premature aging, and more
In fact, sugar is bad for your health in so many ways, I’ve compiled an entire list outlining 76 Ways in Which Sugar Can Damage Your Health!
But even if you’re not eating a children’s cereal -- let’s say you’re eating a more “adult” oriented cereal that’s high in fiber and low in sugar -- it is still not a healthy breakfast choice.
Why?
Because cereal is mostly grain, and grains rapidly break down to sugar in your body, stimulating insulin production. So, if you:
Are overweight
Have high cholesterol
Have high blood pressure
Have diabetes
... then you are best served avoiding cereal for breakfast.
If your nutritional type is carbohydrate oriented and you don’t have any of the above problems, then grains are a possible option for you. But, rest assured, if you indulge in grains to excess you are heading for one of the above diseases.
Further, to keep your energy up and feel satisfied, you should really strive to include a healthy source of protein and fat, according to your nutritional type, with your breakfast.
That is really what my nutrition plan is all about -- AVOIDING grains, such as bagels, cereal and pancakes, and replacing them with high-quality proteins (such as eggs), healthy fats (INCLUDING saturated fat) and low glycemic complex carbs, mostly from veggies.
What is a Healthier Breakfast Option for Kids (and for You)?
It is very important that you start your day off with a healthy breakfast, as studies have shown that eating breakfast can have beneficial effects on:
Appetite
Insulin resistance
Energy metabolism
One study even found that obesity and insulin resistance syndrome rates were 35 percent to 50 percent lower among people who ate breakfast every day, compared to those who frequently skipped it.
But there’s more to it than simply not skipping the meal. You need to give your body high-quality fuel to run off of for the day. And sugary breakfast cereals do not qualify.
So what is an example of a healthy breakfast that will keep you feeling energized and at the top of your game for hours?
My primary recommendation for Carb and Mixed nutritional types is to prepare and consume fresh vegetable juice, making sure to also eat the pulp. (It’s loaded with so many valuable phytonutrients, it would be unwise to discard it.)
Veggie juice is a really simple breakfast alternative, and suitable even for your youngest ones. It’s also a good source of fiber — in fact, I recommend getting 50 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories consumed. If you want to add some protein and fat, try adding some raw cream, raw kefir or a raw egg or two.
Juicing may not be the best option for Protein types (like me), however, so if your child is a Protein type, you’d want to limit them to 10 ounces or less of raw juice each day, and restrict the vegetables to lower potassium varieties such as spinach and celery.
Prior to understanding Nutritional Typing I used to juice vegetables, but now my breakfast contains far more fat. I typically make a porridge with several ounces of fresh raw coconut cream (which I obtain locally as it’s not available commercially). Then I mix in 2-3 raw organic free-range eggs, some rice bran, and some raw organic nuts, ground organic hemp seeds and coconut milk. That typically keeps me going strong until lunch.
So please give some serious thoughts to what types of foods your child is eating for breakfast. Proper childhood nutrition is so important if you want to set the stage for lifelong health that I wrote an entire book on the subject called Generation XL: Raising Healthy, Intelligent Kids in a High-Tech, Junk-Food World.
It even includes 74 pages of kid-approved recipes, brimming with all-natural, healthy choices that will satisfy even your picky eaters. So if you’re looking for even more options to wean your kids off breakfast cereal, this book is an excellent place to find them."

What You Need to Know for a Happy and Stress-Free Pregnancy
Making sure that your baby gets a healthy start in life is one of your biggest priorities. That means ensuring that your nutritional intake is at optimal levels.
The purpose of this article is to give you the absolute best and most current recommendations that I have culled from over three decades of being involved in health care. I know it is a major challenge to sort through all the confusion, so I am going to do the hard work for you and provide some simple, practical, and solid tips for helping you to bring the healthiest child possible into this world.
Some of the main things I will be discussing with you include the importance of:
Healthy daily doses of omega-3s
Optimizing your vitamin D levels
Regular exercise
Eating for vitality and health
Just saying no to vaccinations
Removing your mercury amalgams
Treating severe gum disease
Minimizing pesticide exposure
Using the safest cosmetics
Avoiding exposure to phthalates
The Importance of Omega-3 Fats During Pregnancy
After reviewing many tens of thousands of articles on nutrition, I am convinced that the single most important dietary influence on your prenatal health is adequate omega-3 fats.1 Most women have major deficiencies of this fat, and given the statistics, it's very possible you do too.
A study in March 1991 at the Mayo Clinic of 19 ""normal"" pregnant women consuming normal diets showed that all were deficient in omega-3 fats. Another study of Inuit (Eskimo) women, compared to Canadian women, revealed omega-3 deficiency in the milk of the Canadian nursing mothers.2
Omega-3 fat and its derivative, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), is so essential to a child's development that if a mother and infant are deficient in it, the child's nervous system and immune system may never fully develop, and it can cause a lifetime of unexplained emotional, learning, and immune system disorders.
While most people are seriously lacking in omega-3s, they are overdoing another type of fat: omega-6. The ideal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats is 1:1. Today, though, most Americans' ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 averages from 20:1 to 50:1! 3
It's very important to get your omega-6 to omega-3 ratio closer to the ideal 1:1. To do this, simply cut back on all vegetable oils (this includes those in processed foods, like cookies, chips, and crackers) and get a regular supply of high-quality omega-3 fat, which I'll be telling you how to do, later on.
In the next few sections you'll learn even more reasons why omega-3s are so critical to you and your baby's health, and why I recommend that every pregnant woman maintain an optimal daily dose of omega-3s.
Omega-3s Provide Phenomenal Protection Against Prematurity
Optimizing your omega-3 intake will virtually guarantee that your baby will be full term. Prematurity is the leading cause of death during a baby's first month of life, and serious complications can occur later in life for preemies who survive.4 Studies show that the earlier a child is born, the higher the risk of complications, including:
Respiratory distress syndrome
Bleeding in the brain
Less ability to fight off infection due to immature immune system
Mental retardation
Cerebral palsy
Lung problems
Gastrointestinal problems
Vision and hearing loss.
The good news is that the DHA in animal-based omega-3 fats will prevent the vast majority of premature deliveries, 5 as well as the other complications listed above.
More Omega-3 Benefits for Mom And Baby
Omega-3s contain a powerhouse of nutrients to ensure that your baby will develop properly and reach its highest potential. These nutrients help to maximize the intelligence7 of your child, and protect your baby from brain injuries such as autism, pervasive developmental delay, and ADHD.
Studies have shown that sufficient levels of omega-3 fats optimize brain growth in children, especially during the third trimester.8
And in addition, omega-3 fats have been found to be highly effective in combating cardiovascular disease and depression. With hormones fluctuating so wildly during this time, you might find yourself dealing with some depression. It is a very common occurrence in pregnancy.
Research has now shown that low plasma concentrations of DHA, one of the main fats in omega-3 oil, are associated with low concentrations of brain serotonin. Serotonin has a calming effect on your brain and nervous system, so it is no surprise that a lack of it caused study participants to feel depressed and suicidal.9
However, in a British study, researchers found that women who consumed greater amounts of omega-3 fatty acids during the third trimester were less likely to show signs of major depression during pregnancy, and for up to eight months after the birth.10
Dietary supplementation with omega-3 oil concentrates has also been shown to reduce both the progression of cardiovascular disease and related mortality, including sudden cardiac death,11 so make sure you get plenty of this critical nutrient to protect you and your baby during this important time.
Another great benefit of adding omega-3 oils to your diet is that they will help prevent your child from developing diabetes later in life.18 This goes back to the role of omega-3 fats in helping you carry your baby to term. Studies show that premature babies have a greater risk of developing diabetes. Let me also add that studies link this tendency towards diabetes to a lack of sufficient vitamin D prior to birth.
Hopefully all this has convinced you how important it is to have plenty of omega-3s in your diet so you can be amply protected against these risk factors during pregnancy.
Finding the Best Sources of Omega-3s
In past years, I have recommended that the best way to obtain your essential omega-3 fats was to consume fish, but because of the ever-increasing danger of ingesting too much mercury, my current belief is that fish should generally be avoided. The mercury contained in fish has been well documented to cause a variety of neurological birth defects.12,13
Even the conservative FDA has warned that women should avoid most fish during pregnancy.14
Because of this issue, I recommend that you supplement your diet with a high-quality krill oil instead.15 Krill are small, shrimp-like crustaceans that inhabit the Earth's oceans. The purest oil is made from krill that are harvested in the deep, clean waters of the Antarctic.16
The reason I prefer krill oil to fish oil is that krill oil contains potent antioxidants, whereas fish oil is weaker in antioxidant content.
The major drawback to taking fish oil is that, as you increase your intake of omega-3 fats, you actually increase your need for more antioxidants.
Why it this?
Because fish oil is quite perishable, and oxidation leads to the formation of those unhealthy free radicals. Therefore, you need to take antioxidants to ensure that the fish oil doesn't oxidize and become rancid inside your body. But krill oil makes life simpler because you don't need to pop extra antioxidants every time you take your omega-3s.
And the essential fatty acids DHA and EPA are also present in krill oil. At one time, fatty fish like salmon was an excellent source of these acids, but because of the mercury contamination mentioned previously, as well as PCB contamination17 and even more, it is no longer a safe choice.
All these contaminants outweigh the benefits you could get from their omega-3 content (particularly since you can get them from krill oil, which is purified of contaminants). And please note that your prenatal vitamins do not contain one microgram of DHA!
Another healthy source for obtaining omega-3 is beef fed exclusively on grass. If you can find a local producer, it would be wise to seek out this food source.
Are Plant Sources of Omega-3 Acceptable?
It is important to note that plant-based omega 3 fats do not provide the same benefits as animal-based, because most of us can't convert the ALA in plant-based fats to the appropriate amount of DHA that is required.6
Flax seeds, walnuts, and other plant sources of omega-3 should not be substituted for animal omega-3s, as you will simply not receive the same benefits because they are not metabolized as efficiently. For more information and precautions about nuts during pregnancy, please see the section titled Limit Nuts.
Add Sunshine for Optimally Healthy Baby
Without question one of the single most important strategies you can have for a healthy baby is to make sure you have optimal vitamin D levels. There is about a 90 percent chance that you do NOT have healthy vitamin D levels for a variety of reasons.
If you work indoors a lot, it's likely you don't have sufficient levels of vitamin D, because sunlight is where most or all of our vitamin D comes from. Also, if you live in a northern latitudes where you don't spend much time outdoors even when you aren't working, there's an extra good chance you may be D-deficient as well.
Your windows also screen out the vast majority of UVB rays from the sun shining through, so you will NOT generate significant levels of vitamin D by sitting in front of a sunny window. There are other benefits to doing that, but generating healthy vitamin D levels is not one of them.19
A recent study has shown that even in you live in more southern areas and spend more time outdoors, you may still be deficient in vitamin D. The study showed that adults in southern Arizona were found to be deficient in vitamin D, particularly those with darker skin which produces less vitamin D in response to sunlight.
More than a quarter of Arizona adults who were tested had dangerously low blood levels of the vitamin.
On top of that, most people don't eat much vitamin-D rich fish, which these days is actually a good thing. While missing the vitamin D, you and your baby are also happily missing the high mercury levels that most fish contain,20 due to the ongoing pollution of our waters.
I believe the very best way to optimize your vitamin D level is with regular exposure of large portions of your skin to the sun. However, I realize that may be difficult if it's snowing outside, so that's why I recommend you get your vitamin D from an oral form of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).
Vitamin D3 comes from fish oil, and is the best and most effective form of oral vitamin D. Vitamin D3 is also found in eggs, organ meats, animal fat, cod liver oil, and fish. It is the equivalent to the vitamin D3 formed on your skin from UV-B.
However, you must have your blood levels checked before you begin any supplementation program. This is best done by a nutritionally oriented physician. The advantage of having your medical doctor perform the test is that it will usually be covered by your medical insurance.
It is also very important that you order the correct test.21 There are two tests with very similar names, so don't be confused. They are 1,25(OH)D and 25(OH)D. The correct test is 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
Make Sure Your Doctor Uses the Correct Testing Lab
Recent developments in 2008 also made it clear that there are irregularities in the values obtained from different testing methods. So while you may get results from any of the three assays that are analytically accurate, they might not be clinically accurate, which is, ultimately, what matters.
Therefore, in order for the test to offer you clinically relevant results, I recommend using LabCorp. Their radioimmunoassay (RIA) method for measuring total vitamin D levels has become the gold standard, not because it's more accurate than others, but because it's the one used in almost every major vitamin D study, on which the blood levels for clinical efficacy are based. 22
As far as test results, you should strive for levels of 60 ng/ml. This is currently considered the optimal level for vitamin D.
Add Exercise to Your Daily Schedule
Exercise should be an important part of your health routine while you're pregnant, as long as your doctor has not indicated otherwise. In fact, vigorous exercise has been shown to decrease the possibility of premature birth.23
In a study conducted between 1995 and 1998, close to 1,700 pregnant women were questioned about their leisure activity during the three months before pregnancy, as well as during the first and second trimesters. Of the women questioned, 22 percent exercised vigorously before pregnancy -- 14 percent during the first trimester, and eight percent during the second. Vigorous activity included jogging or bicycling at a moderate to fast pace, swimming, or aerobic, fast-paced dancing.
Women who exercised vigorously during the first trimester were 20 percent less likely to deliver prematurely, compared with those who did not. Those who reported vigorous activity during their second trimester reduced their risk of premature, or pre-term birth, by 48 percent.
A later study indicated that women who exercised at the same rate throughout their pregnancies had larger placentas than their more sedentary peers. The volume of the placenta is a general marker of its ability to transport oxygen and nutrients to your baby. The study also indicated that a more intense exercise regimen may result in babies who weigh less at birth.24 However, none of the babies born to women who exercised moderately or intensely through the ninth month were considered unhealthy.
These findings indicate that regular weight-bearing exercise is beneficial for both you and your baby, and that the amount of benefit varies with the timing and amount of exercise.
Eating for Two
I'm sure you have heard the term ""eating for two."" For many years, mothers-to-be were told that because they were pregnant, they must eat for two. But this is a very misleading statement. Some women gain far too much weight in the misguided belief that they must provide additional nutrition for their growing child.
Others may simply use this statement as an excuse to eat whatever they want. In either case, surveys now show that roughly half of all pregnant women are overweight or obese.25
The truth is, obesity can wreak havoc on your health, and that havoc will extend throughout your pregnancy and affect your unborn child. The side-effects of obesity include birth defects,26 infertility,27 heart disease,28 and much more. Studies also show that overweight or obese women have a greater tendency than normal-weight women to produce children who will also become overweight.29
So it's important to your health and to your baby's to keep your weight within reasonable parameters, so you can both avoid problems down the road.
Eating the Right Foods for Baby
While it is true that we should always strive to eat properly, remember that a precious cargo – your baby -- is now sharing your food supply. His little body has no choice but to try to make good nutrition from whatever you eat, so it is more important than ever to choose the right foods so that he can be assured of a strong, healthy adulthood.
In general, choose fresh, organic foods whenever possible. And eat a well-balanced diet consisting of adequate protein, healthy fats, fruits and vegetables.
Be sure to include plenty of leafy green vegetables, because they are loaded with folic acid, a B vitamin that studies have shown reduces the chance of your child being born with neural tube defects. Neural tube defects are a type of birth defect that affects the brain and spinal cord, and includes spina bifida.30
You can find many good sources of locally grown organic vegetables and fruits at your neighborhood farmer's market.31 A good way to make sure you are eating properly is to eat according to your Nutritional Type.™
There are basically three Nutritional Types™:
Protein
Carb
Mixed. 32
Protein types do better on low-carbohydrate, high-protein, and high-fat diets. Carb types normally feel best when the majority of their food is carbohydrate. However, I do not mean refined carbs, such as from commercial cakes, pies, cookies, and the like. They will only create more health problems. Getting most of your carbohydrates from vegetables is very important.
And, if your Nutritional Type™ is mixed, your requirements are between the carb and protein types.
Ascertaining whether you are a Protein, Carb, or Mixed Type will assure that you get the right balance of foods to nourish your particular metabolism. You can find out more about all of these Nutritional Types™ at Mercola.com.
Eggs -- Powerful Pregnancy Allies
A very important food for pregnancy are raw eggs.33 Raw eggs are a rich source of protein, carotenoids, and choline. Eggs contain yellow or orange carotenoids called lutein and zeaxanthin. Studies have shown that high dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin is associated with a significant reduction in the risk for:
Cataracts (up to a 20-percent reduction)
Age-related macular degeneration (up to a 40-percent reduction).34
Other good sources of lutein and zeaxanthin are green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli.
Choline, another important nutrient in eggs, has been shown to improve learning and memory in animals. Researchers say this data could mean that choline can boost human cognitive function, diminish age-related memory decline, and decrease toxic ""insults"" to the brain.35
Also, despite what you may have heard, the risk of salmonella from raw eggs is extremely low when you buy healthy, organic eggs. Salmonella infections are usually present only in traditionally raised commercial hens. If you are purchasing your eggs from healthy chickens, the infection risk reduces dramatically. Remember, only sick chickens lay salmonella-contaminated eggs. If you are obtaining high quality, cage-free, organically fed, omega-3-enhanced chicken eggs, the risk virtually disappears.
Other egg myths that should be debunked are that eggs increase cholesterol levels or are a causative factor in heart disease. The most recent research has clearly shown that eggs do not cause a worsening of cholesterol, nor do they increase the risk of heart disease.36
What researchers in previous studies never took into account, when studying the link between bad cholesterol and eggs, are the specific subclasses of LDL cholesterol. The smaller fractions of LDL are more dangerous and are associated with an increased risk of heart disease, while the larger ones are not dangerous. So rest assured, if you choose free-range, organic eggs, they are one of the healthiest, and safest, foods you can eat.

A few notes about breastfeeding. After you deliver your baby, you should keep the following points in mind when deciding about breastfeeding your infant. I strongly recommend breastfeeding because it strengthens your child's immune system, protecting him against many physiological assaults later in life.
One of the reasons for this is that a healthy mother's milk is high in essential fats, GLA, and other precursors to prostaglandins (potent, hormone-like substances that control a wide range of physiological functions such as blood pressure, contraction of smooth muscle, and modulation of inflammation).
However, cow's milk is low in essential fats and other prostaglandin precursors, and high in saturated fats. For this reason, cow's milk is not an adequate substitute for mother's milk. Neither is baby formula.
At a recent international symposium on Dietary Omega-3 and -6 Fatty Acids, Dr. Neuringer, an authority on infant milk, stated that the low omega-3, high omega-6 content in infant formulas was of great concern because of the imbalance it causes among the prostaglandins.37 These imbalances can impair your baby's immune system and predispose your infant to cancer and heart trouble later in life.
However, should you decide not to breastfeed, feeding your baby a few drops of flax seed oil daily will help to make up the deficiency of omega-3 essential fatty acids .
Are Vaccinations Really Necessary?
Many mothers may feel that vaccinations are beneficial, and without them, they or their baby might suffer harm. Nothing could be further from the truth.
First and foremost, vaccines contain mercury, which has been shown, even in low concentrations, to impair energy production, impair neurotubule stability (neurotubules are essential to normal brain cell function), and activate brain free radical production, among many other destructive things.38
To avoid these potentially grave effects, you should avoid all vaccinations while you are pregnant, as well as avoid having your baby get any vaccinations after birth.
The brain has one of the highest metabolic rates of any organ, and impairment of its energy supply, especially during your baby's development, can have devastating consequences.
A study undertaken by Dr. Thomas Verstraeten, representing the CDC at that time, looked at data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink and found a significant correlation between thimerosal (49.6% mercury by weight) exposure in vaccines and several neuro-developmental disorders including tics, speech delays, and possibly even ADD.39
Despite the damning evidence that vaccines contained a potent neurotoxin, and despite recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and others that thimerosal be removed, five years after the Verstraeten study, in 2004, the CDC still insisted that there was no scientific evidence of harm from exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines.40
Currently, California, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, New York, and Washington ban thimerosal in vaccines.41
Furthermore, children are getting mandated to have more and more vaccines at younger and younger ages. It has gotten so ridiculous, not to mention dangerous, for children whose immune systems are delicate and still developing, to have this many vaccinations.
Under the conventional schedule of immunizations, before a child reaches the age of two, he or she will have received 32 vaccinations, including four doses each of vaccines for Hemophilus influenzae type b infections, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis -- all of them given during the first 12 months of life. Seven vaccines injected into a 13-pound, two-month old infant are equivalent to 70 doses in a 130-pound adult!
In the wake of this, Dr. Donald Miller, a medical doctor and instructor of cardiac surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine, has suggested a better approach, what he calls a ""user friendly vaccination schedule.""
Dr. Miller states that the most rapid period of brain development begins in the third trimester, and continues over the first two years of extra uterine life.42 He believes that until randomized controlled trials demonstrate the safety of giving vaccines during this time of life, it would be prudent not to give any vaccinations to children until they are 2 years old.
Also, his user-friendly vaccination schedule requires that vaccinations, after the age of two, be given no more than once every six months, one at a time, in order to allow the child's immune system sufficient time to recover and stabilize between shots.

Remove Your Mercury Amalgams
Please understand that if you have mercury amalgam ""silver"" fillings, you are dumping the mercury from your fillings into your baby. Ideally, it would be best to remove your fillings BEFORE you become pregnant. But if you are already pregnant, it is probably best not to remove your fillings until after you deliver.
And if you have mercury amalgams, it would be wise to avoid chewing gum, because chewing liberates mercury vapors that can deposit in your child.43 And mercury vapor easily enters breast milk, so this is an ongoing issue after birth as well.
Studies have already shown that mercury in the mother can cause birth defects in her child, but the orthodox medical community has remained slow to accept this, until just recently.
The FDA reluctantly admitted last year that the mercury contained in amalgam fillings ""may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses.""44
At least two studies have shown that elemental mercury accumulation within a developing baby increases with time, so that the levels of mercury in the fetal organs are significantly higher toward the end of the pregnancy than during early pregnancy.45
And it is now confirmed that mercury levels in a baby's brain reach even higher levels following birth, despite an end to exposure from the mother's mercury. Researchers think this is due to a redistribution of the mercury from the fetus' liver to its brain.
This transfer of mercury from a mother to her child has been confirmed in at least two human studies as well.46 Another case involved a female surgeon exposed to 0.05mg/M3 mercury vapor at work, who bore a baby with severe brain damage. The baby's blood mercury was shown to be elevated.
The study stated that these levels of mercury can easily occur when a pregnant mother has a large number of dental amalgam fillings, chews gum, and is exposed to hot food and drinks.
Therefore, if you have mercury amalgams, not only avoid gum chewing, but also try to let liquids and food cool down before eating, so they do not liberate more mercury.
There are some other steps that you can take to help protect your baby from mercury toxicity, and diminish possible harm. Vitamin C and selenium are both helpful when it comes to protection from the toxic effects of mercury. For example, we know that vitamin C detoxifies oxidized fat, and that it can also protect your body against DNA damage.47
Selenium, a trace mineral found in fish, meat, eggs, and some other foods, helps your immune system defend against viruses. Selenium has also been shown to bind with mercury, and logically, should cause it to be excreted from the body.
If you decide to take a selenium supplement, be sure to choose inorganic selenium rather than organic, since the organic form can build up in the tissues, while excess inorganic selenium is excreted automatically.48
Both of these natural aids, as well as eating a properly balanced diet with plenty of green, leafy vegetables and fresh, organic foods, should help afford protection for you and your baby until you deliver and are through with breastfeeding. At that time, I recommend that you have your mercury amalgams removed by a dentist licensed in mercury removal protocols.
Protect Your Child from Pesticide Exposure
Alarming statistics have been coming to light daily about the dangers of exposure to pesticides and other chemicals. A 2007 article in the Los Angeles Times reported that women who lived near California farm fields that were sprayed with organochlorine pesticides might be more likely to give birth to children with autism.51
The autism rate was highest for children whose mothers lived closest to the fields, while it declined as the distance from the fields increased.
Another study, conducted in 2008, found that pregnant women who worked at a Denmark greenhouse reported that their sons had a higher incidence of reproductive abnormalities than had been preciously reported in that area, and their blood hormone levels differed significantly from normal.52
Additional studies have found that exposure to chemicals has been believed to be a causative factor in miscarriages,53 childhood learning problems,54 and even fetal death.55
This indicates how critical it is to make sure you safely dispose of any pesticides around your house so you do not come in contact with them, and preferably, have someone else do it so you won't risk further exposure.
And, if you have a job that potentially could expose you to hazardous chemicals while you are pregnant, consider taking a leave of absence or otherwise distancing yourself from the source of the chemicals.
Dangers Lurking Inside Your Home
The previous studies just concerned chemicals outside the home. But with the increasing use of all types of commercial household cleansers, even your home can be an unsafe place.
A recent study involving almost 14,000 children was conducted to see if there was a link between prenatal exposure to cleaning supplies and asthma. The children in the study were followed until they reached 3-and-a-half years of age. Results from the study revealed that the babies who were exposed to these chemicals most frequently were the ones most likely to develop persistent wheezing as young children.56
Some of the chemicals most likely to be used in the home by pregnant women include:
Bleach
Carpet Cleaner
Dry Cleaning Fluid
Aerosols
Turpentine/White Spirit
Air Fresheners
Paint Stripper
Paint or Varnish
Pesticide/Insecticides
Window Cleaner
Toilet Bowl Cleaners
So, how can you protect yourself and your baby from these dangers? Here are some guidelines:
The easiest way is by not introducing these kinds of chemicals into your home in the first place. Especially if you are pregnant, they could potentially be harmful to your unborn child.
Consider getting rid of your existing towels, sponges, rags, and other conventional tools you clean your home with, as they are some of the top sources for illness-causing germs in your home. They also do a very poor job of cleaning the biological and toxic aspects of dirt in your home.
Make dietary changes to strengthen your immune system, as I describe in the section, Eating The Right Foods For Baby.
So What Should I Use to Clean My House?
I have discovered that a safe and inexpensive way to clean your house and to avoid the effects of harmful chemicals on your baby, is by using either vinegar alone as a cleaning agent, or with the addition of hydrogen peroxide.57 This combination works exceptionally well both as a disinfectant and a sanitizer.
And it's economical as well. For example, it only takes a half-cup of white vinegar to make a quart of this simple, all-purpose cleaner.
Other economical and effective cleaners that are equally safe to use inside your home before and after pregnancy, can be made from ingredients such as white vinegar, baking soda, salt, and lemon juice. These items should be readily available in your kitchen or easily purchased, and have been proven effective as cleaning ingredients for generations.
There are also home cleaning ""recipes"" you can make that are safe to use during your pregnancy, such as those found at ems.org. These will help you create cleaning products that will also be environmentally safe, so they are a good investment for the future of our planet as well.58
Beautify Yourself Safely
While you are being careful to protect your baby from the potential chemicals in many areas, be sure to consider the toxins in your everyday cosmetics. Over time, the chemicals in these products can impact both you and your baby's nervous systems, reproductive systems, and cause other health issues.
Most cosmetics, such as hair dyes, hair sprays, facial make-up, and fingernail polish are composed of a dizzying array of chemical compounds. The Toxic Chemicals Laboratory of New York State College studied many of the chemicals and found them to be mutagenic (having the ability to damage genes and chromosomes).59
Recent studies have confirmed that these neurotoxins can easily pass through your blood and affect your unborn child. Unlike an adult, your growing baby does not have a functional blood-brain barrier to protect itself from toxic insult. This lack of a natural defense allows chemicals into your baby's brain with the potential to cause serious harm, such as a disruption in the delicate brain growth process.60
In another study, a University of Nijmegen, Netherlands student investigated 306 mentally retarded children and their mother's job occupations. Results showed a 3.7 times increased risk of women cosmotologists having a mentally retarded child after being routinely exposed to hair care products or dyes during her pregnancy.61
However, you can avoid exposure to these chemicals by avoiding commercial cosmetics and hair care products, and seeking out natural items from your local health food store.62 You can also purchase safe cosmetics online.
EWG has a safe cosmetic site where you can purchase cosmetics, lotions, and other products that can keep you and your baby safe from harm. Find out further information at Mercola.com by entering the keywords ""three green beauty"" in the search window.
Halt Gum Disease
It's clear from numerous studies that pregnant women who suffer from dental disease have an increased risk of premature birth. One study found that the worse the gum disease is, the more likely a woman is to have a pre-term birth.63 While scientists are still studying the biological mechanisms, animal research has shown that periodontal infections impair fetal growth.
So what can you do to minimize the risk? A number of things. Recently, studies have shown a strong correlation between increased vitamin C use and healthier gums.
In one such study, researchers analyzed the vitamin C intakes and periodontal disease indicators in over 12,000 adults, and found that patients who consumed less than the recommended 60 mg per day (about one orange) were at nearly one-and-a-half times the risk of developing severe gingivitis as those who consumed three times the RDA (more than 180 mg).64
And in a 2005 German study, people with gum disease who ate two grapefruit a day for two weeks showed significantly less bleeding from their gums.65
Lack of vitamin C has also been linked to premature deliveries and preeclampsia (pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and swelling due to fluid retention).66,67 Women with preeclampsia were found to have lower blood levels of vitamin C than women without the condition.
So my best recommendation is that you increase your consumption of vitamin C-rich foods. These include citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruits, as well as kiwi fruit, cantaloupe, strawberries, tomatoes, cabbage, sweet red peppers, and broccoli. You should eat these foods fresh rather than canned, as canning destroys most of the vitamin C, and drastically reduces most of the other vitamins as well.
If you have diabetes, blood sugar abnormalities, or other conditions that might limit your intake of citrus fruits, which are some of the foods highest in vitamin C content, you can supplement with vitamin C in the form of Ester-C. This form of vitamin C has been shown to absorb significantly better and faster than regular ascorbic acid.68
But just how much vitamin C is enough? Dr. Linus Pauling, a leader in vitamin C research for many years and the author of a number of books on the subject, suggests that adults take at least 2 grams of vitamin C daily.
While that's well over the recommended R.D.A., Dr. Pauling states, ""There is much evidence about increased health with 2 grams a day, and of course even more with 4 or 6 grams a day.""69
Other vitamins that play a role in improving your periodontal health include folic acid and vitamins A and E. In one study, patients with normal plasma folate levels ingested 2 mg folic acid or a placebo twice daily for 30 days, under double-blind conditions. The folate increased the resistance of the gingiva to local irritants, leading to a reduction in inflammation--even though plasma folate levels were unchanged.70
Vitamins A and E have been linked to a marked reduction in periodontal inflammation during pregnancy,71 so be sure you get plenty of these in your diet.
Vitamin A is plentiful in beef and chicken livers, mangos, apricots, carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, spinach, and kale.
Vitamin E-rich foods include mustard greens, chard, sunflower seeds, spinach, and almonds.
But along with loading up on these vitamin-packed foods, be sure you greatly decrease or stop your intake of sugary foods and sweets. Excess sugar in your diet worsens gum disease. Once eaten, sugar becomes gooey, sticks to your teeth, and is difficult to remove. It forms plaque, which, if allowed to remain on your teeth for even a short time, can cause dental decay and periodontal disease.72
That's why my personal preference for optimizing oral hygiene is the use of a dental scaler, the instrument that dental hygienists use. It seems to be one of the most effective ways to remove the plaque and help prevent dental and gum disease.73
This must be used carefully, however, as you could damage your gums and teeth otherwise. I also enjoy using a hydro-floss, a magnetic water pik, which can also remove scale on your teeth.
Can Plastic Hurt Your Unborn Child?
Exposure to phthalates, a chemical commonly used in plastics, could cause you to be at risk for birth defects, as well as for a shortened pregnancy. A recent study researched various chemicals, nicknamed ""gender-benders,"" that have been released into the environment, and found that the chemicals are causing male animals and male humans to take on feminine characteristics.
As I'm sure you'll agree, this is a very alarming trend! But is it really true? Are males slowly ""disappearing,"" morphing into females?
Well, many studies now indicate these toxins may indeed be wreaking silent havoc within our male population. Male infertility is on the rise,74 and about 250,000 fewer boys have been born in the last 30 years in the United States and Japan.
Scientists are linking these phenomenon to a body accumulation of these types of gender-bending toxins.
In Britain, scientists found that 50 percent of the male fish in lowland waters were growing eggs in their testes. Hermaphrodite polar bears have also been born.75 Their disturbing findings are also relevant for humans, because all vertebrates have similar sex hormone receptors.
Another study reported that women exposed to phthalates gave birth more than one week earlier than women who were not exposed to them.76
Exposure to phthalates is extremely common among pregnant women. These chemicals are added to numerous products including moisturizers, nail polishes, hairsprays, insect repellants, and more. They are also added to plastic products such as food containers, to add flexibility. The chemicals are known to leach out of these products and into the environment.
It was previously thought that exposure to phthalates occurred primarily through ingesting contaminated foods. But researchers have now found that phthalates can be inhaled and even absorbed through the skin, significantly increasing your exposure.
There is another chemical I want to warn you about, and that is Bisphenol A, or simply BPA. This chemical is used in hard, clear plastics such as baby bottles, food-storage containers, and the lining of soda cans. Every year, over 6 billion tons of BPA are used to make polycarbonate plastics.77
This chemical can mimic hormones and cause birth defects. BPA can leach out of plastic products into food, and it is also a danger in baby formula cans.78 Studies indicate it can also lead to early puberty.
Yet another plastic I recommend you avoid at all cost is Teflon, also known as PFOA. Manufactured by DuPont, this common, non-stick substance coats many cooking implements – frying pans, cooking pans, bake ware, even utensils. It is also found in anything from clothes to stain repellents, food packaging, and once again, cosmetics. 79 In addition, DuPont uses Teflon in other products such as firefighting foam and phone cables.
In a study conducted by DuPont itself, it was found that employees exposed to PFOA had elevated levels of total cholesterol and fats called triglycerides, which can increase the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke.80 However, in typical fashion, common to most companies whose products are their livelihood, DuPont denied that there was any association between exposure to PFOA and the employee's symptoms.
And in infants, preliminary findings of a study at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have linked PFOA to lower birth weights among newborns. The study sampled the blood of 300 newborns and looked at the levels of a variety of fluorinated chemicals in relation to their birth weight, head circumference, and other developmental markers.
The results? The higher the infants' level of exposure to PFOA, the lower their birth weight and head size.81
I previously ran a news item detailing the dangers of using products coated with Teflon.82 Specifically, the article reported that Teflon has been appearing in people and animals worldwide -- one study even found that in 23 states, 96 percent of 598 children tested had traces of the chemical in their blood!
The Environmental Protection Agency later made a statement, based on a risk assessment study done on animals, that exposure to PFOA creates a potential risk of developmental and other adverse effects, and they fined DuPont $16.5 million for hiding data on PFOA toxicity for more than 20 years.83
Because of these dangers, I would strongly suggest you avoid contact with these chemicals as much as possible by choosing natural care products. This is also a powerful motivator for choosing a place to live that is minimally polluted, so your developing child and others in your family will be protected from harm.
Other Pregnancy Do's and Don'ts
DO:
Eat a healthy breakfast
Get plenty of sleep
Use probiotics
Avoid anti-bacterial soaps
Limit cell phone use
Get a Good Start with Breakfast
You have certainly heard the statement that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and there's a good reason for that. According to a 1992 study, eating breakfast appears to have beneficial effects on appetite, insulin resistance, and energy metabolism.84 Spanning eight years, this study followed the breakfast habits and risk factors for heart disease in over 2,800 adults, black and white, between the ages of 25-37.
The findings showed that obesity and insulin resistance syndrome rates were 35 percent to 50 percent lower among those who ate breakfast every day, compared to those who frequently skipped it. And eating a good breakfast makes sure that your baby is amply supplied with all the nutrients it needs for proper growth and development.
So when you plan your breakfasts, or other meals, make sure your baby doesn't share in any former junk food habits of yours, or be exposed to foods that can later cause allergic reactions, diabetes, or other lifelong problems. You should therefore immediately exclude:
Doughnuts
Cereals
Fruit juice
Waffles and pancakes
Bagels, toast, and cereals (usually even whole-grain, organic types).
While there are some people who can tolerate whole grains and even thrive on them, others cannot. It is safe to assume that you should avoid them if you:
Are overweight
Have high cholesterol
Have high blood pressure
Have diabetes
Have food allergies to wheat, oats, rye, or other grains.85
If one more of these factors are present, you will best be served by avoiding these foods.
However, if you are a Nutritional Type86 that is carbohydrate-oriented (this is only one-third of people) and you don't have any of the above problems, then grains are a possible option for you.
If you abide by these guidelines, you will find that your health will improve and you will have fewer pregnancy-related problems.
Get Your Zzzzzzzs if You Want a Healthy Baby
Sleep plays as dramatic a role in your overall health as do proper nutrition and regular exercise. Without sufficient sleep, your body will be challenged to reach its optimal state of health, and your baby's wellbeing will also suffer. So getting sufficient sleep should be a priority in your life.
Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes talked with sleep researchers across the country and found out some interesting things. For example, you can die from sleep deprivation, just like you can die from being deprived of food, and sleep deprivation can cause changes in your brain activity similar to those experienced by people with psychiatric disorders.
Further, sleep deprivation puts your body into a pre-diabetic state, and makes you feel hungry, even if you've already eaten. And consistent sleep deprivation can also raise your blood pressure and make you a prime candidate for a heart attack or stroke.87
Your body depends on your biological clock (circadian rhythm) to steadily regulate your sleep/wake cycles. But when this process gets thrown off balance -- which is, unfortunately, very easy to do -- it can wreak havoc on you and your baby's health.
So how much sleep is enough? Sleep research indicates that if you are getting less than 6 hours a night, you are not getting enough sleep.88
Although there is little or no data on how sleep deprivation in the mother affects her baby, since sleep deprivation affects your immune system, you can be sure that it also affects your baby's. And it is logical that when you lose sleep it can also affect your baby adversely, so to be safe, maintain good sleep habits.
Studies show that sleep deprivation can also leave you susceptible to many diseases, including diabetes,89 obesity,90 and even cancer. 91
Pregnant women often need several hours more sleep than usual during their first three months of pregnancy.92 A good rule of thumb to follow is that if you feel tired when you wake, you probably aren't getting enough sleep.
But don't despair. There are ways to erase that sleep debt. Here are a few tips for a better night's sleep:
Get to bed as early as possible. Our systems, particularly the adrenals, do a majority of their recharging or recovering during the hours of 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. In addition, your gallbladder dumps toxins during this same period. If you are awake, the toxins back up into the liver, which then back up into your entire system and cause further disruptions.
Don't drink any water, or just a minimum, within 2 hours of retiring. This will reduce the likelihood, or frequency, of having to get up and go to the bathroom.
Avoid before-bed snacks, particularly grains and sugars. This will raise blood sugar and inhibit sleep. Later, when blood sugar drops too low, you might wake up and not be able to fall back asleep.
Sleep in complete darkness, or as close as possible. If there is even the tiniest bit of light in your room, it can disrupt your circadian rhythm and your pineal gland's production of melatonin and serotonin. There also should be as little light in the bathroom as possible, if you get up in the middle of the night.
Keep your feet warm. Wearing socks to bed can keep you from waking up in the middle of the night. A study has shown that wearing socks to bed reduces night wakings because feet have the poorest circulation, so they often feel cold before the rest of the body.
Keep the temperature in the bedroom no higher than 70 degrees F. Many people keep their homes, and particularly the upstairs bedrooms, too hot. This interferes.
Another thing you should be sure to avoid is either TV or the Internet 30 minutes prior to bed. The blue light coming from your television and computer monitor have been shown to ""power up"" your brain and alter your biological clock. Be expecially careful to avoid video games, because these can keep you hyper for hours after you're done.93

Use Good Bacteria to Optimize Your Intestinal Health
Probiotics could turn out to be an expectant mother's best friend. They are referred to as ""friendly"" bacteria, and are responsible for a number of important biological functions. Some of these include assisting with digestion, keeping other harmful bacteria at bay, and stimulating the immune system.95
A number of studies have proven their many health benefits. Specifically, they have been useful in the prevention or control of:
Premature labor
Food and skin allergies in babies
Inflammatory bowel disease
Recurrent ear and bladder infections
Chronic diarrhea
Bacterial vaginosis.
Researchers in Finland used a type of bacteria found naturally in the gut called Lactobacillus GG (Lactobacillus rhamnosus), to try to prevent allergy development in at-risk infants. This type of bacteria is a safe and effective treatment for allergic inflammation and food allergies in babies.96
Avoid Anti-bacterial Soaps
Antibacterial soaps can be very hazardous to your baby's health as well as to yours. There was much hoopla over these soaps some years ago, yet tests show that they offer little protection against the most common germs -- but more importantly, studies show they actually form a carcinogen when mixed with water.
In a study published in the March 2, 2004 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, participants who used antibacterial soaps and cleansers developed a cough, runny nose, sore throat, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and other symptoms just as often as people who used products that did not contain antibacterial ingredients.97
Further, many traditional medical circles now accept the ""hygiene hypothesis,"" which centers on the idea that children need to be exposed to some bacteria in early childhood in order to strengthen their immune systems. Children who are not exposed to common bacteria, which are wiped out by antibacterial soap, may be more prone to allergies and asthma.98
But a more critical problem is that antibacterial soaps contain triclosan, which can react with chlorine and form a carcinogen.99 Triclosan, which is a widely used antibacterial ingredient in hand sterilization products, breaks down rapidly when exposed to chlorinated water, producing a number of toxic chemicals, including chloroform.
This finding was based on two studies that produced similar results, and researchers concluded that anyone using these products would be exposed to chloroform levels 40 percent higher than that found in tap water.100
Another serious problem with these soaps is that they contribute to the problem of antibiotic-resistant germs, a growing threat to everyone's health.101 When disinfectants are used in low levels, researchers found that they actually make certain bacteria more resistant to antibiotic treatment. This is true in hospital settings, and certainly applies to the low-level disinfectants you may use around your home.
Last but certainly not least, antibacterial products are endocrine disrupters that can contaminate human breast milk, and certainly can also be absorbed through your skin.102
Because infants are so much more susceptible to chemicals than adults, especially in utero, if you have any antibacterial soap or disinfectants in your home, please remove them to avoid harming yourself or your child.
Use Serious Precautions When Using Your Cell Phone
A study by top research scientists concluded that women who use mobile phones when pregnant are more likely to give birth to children with behavioral problems. This study included more than 13,000 children. Pregnant women using the handsets only 2-3 times a day was enough to raise the risk of their babies developing hyperactivity and difficulties with conduct, emotions, and relationships when they reached school age.
The likelihood is even greater if the children themselves used the phones before the age of 7.103

This study is far from being the first showing that the electromagnetic radiation from cell phones poses a hazard to a developing fetus. Animal studies have also shown that electromagnetic fields in that frequency range can affect their liver enzymes, glands, muscles, hormone balance, and heart and bone marrow.
In fact, the cellular stresses caused by information-carrying radio waves have been shown to cause DNA damage to the brain cells of rats,104 and this means they have the potential to alter the DNA structure of a baby in utero.
Aside from the startling findings of this study, I believe that the increase in cell phone usage is also one of the primary causes of the autism epidemic.105
Over 1 billion people who use cell phones on a regular basis are putting their health at risk, along with the health of their children and those waiting to be born, so be sure to keep cell phones away from your baby and other children.
The density of children's skulls is far less than adults', and their brains are more susceptible to damage from information-carrying radio waves. A child in the womb may be near defenseless against this damage.
Here are some tips to minimize the harmful effects of cell phones and other electrical devices on you and your baby:
Do not use a cell phone while pregnant, and don't allow your children to use them.
Limit the amount of time you spend on a cell phone or cordless phone.106
Use a wired headset to limit your exposure. Ideally, an air tube headset that conducts sound but prevents any radiation from traveling up the wire to your brain. Also, make sure the wire is shielded, which prevents it from acting as an antenna that could attract more information-carrying radio waves directly to your brain. Wireless BlueTooth headsets should be avoided.
Limit your exposure to WiFi routers. Find out where they are located in your work environment and stay away from them.
If you have any land-based (non-cellular) portable phones, do NOT use anything other than the 900- MHz phones, as the Gigahertz phones stay on continuously, blasting you with information-carrying radio waves 24/7.
Use the speakerphone instead of putting the phone to your ear; this is probably one of the single most important steps you can take other than not using your cell phone.
Limit calls inside buildings.
Use your cell phone only where reception is good. If reception is poor, your phone has to work harder, and therefore emits a much stronger radiation signal.
Critical Items to Avoid During Pregnancy
Soy products
Caffeine
Nuts
Artificial sweeteners
Fluoridated or chlorinated water
Avoid Soy
Soy products are perhaps the most hazardous of the Don'ts, even when you are not pregnant. But they should be avoided as much as possible during pregnancy, because a diet high in soy during pregnancy and breastfeeding can have a subtle, but long-term impact on the development of your child.
Soybeans contain compounds called phytoestrogens or isoflavones, which have been found to produce a variety of hormonal actions within your body. These hormones can adversely influence the way your baby's brain develops, the way the reproductive organs and cells grow, and even the way immune function develops. 107
Infants exposed to excess amounts of phytoestrogens in utero, or after birth in the form of soy formula, risk a variety of health complications, including early puberty, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems.108 They also are at greater risk for developing severe allergies.
One study has linked soy consumption to brain damage and cancer.109 For more information about the dangers of soy, including its impact on fertility and fetal development, I recommend you check out Kaayla Daniel's excellent book, The Whole Soy Story.
Caffeine Caveat
I've been warning about the dangers of caffeine to pregnant women for years. It has always been my position that no amount of caffeine during pregnancy is safe.
A recent study on caffeine, conducted in 2008, shows that one dose of caffeine -- just two cups of coffee -- ingested during pregnancy, may be enough to affect fetal heart development and reduce heart function over the entire lifespan of the child.110 Take note: that's the equivalent of two cups of coffee during the entire pregnancy – not two cups of coffee per day!
Caffeine is an addictive, stimulant drug that passes easily through the placenta to your developing baby. It is also transferred through breast milk. In babies (newborns and unborn), the half-life of caffeine is extended. It stays in your baby longer, and a developing infant has no ability to detoxify caffeine.
And never, ever -- drink coffee from a Styrofoam cup. The heat draws toxic chemicals from the cup, and you will drink those along with your java.111
Additionally, most coffee contains pesticides, something you definitely don't want in your baby. Pesticides have been linked to stillbirths and miscarriages.111 Also remember that caffeine is not just in coffee, tea, and chocolate, but also in colas and energy drinks, and a number of other beverages. Make sure you carefully check the labels on any beverages before you buy them.
You can do your baby and yourself a favor by swearing off caffeine for your entire pregnancy. And since breastfeeding is the best start you can give your child in life, do your baby another big favor and remain off caffeine for the duration of your breastfeeding as well.
Limit Nuts
Recent research has found that regular consumption of nut products during pregnancy raises the odds of your child having asthma symptoms by nearly 50 percent.
About 4 percent of American children have food allergies, and roughly 3 million people in the U.S. are allergic to peanuts or tree nuts. It's already recommended that children under three not be given nuts or nut products, because their immune systems are still developing and may be more susceptible to allergens.
I think it's important to note that while DAILY consumption of nut products increased the odds that a child would develop asthma, the researchers did not find an association between rare or regular consumption of nuts.112 So this warning is really aimed at those of you who indulge in nut products on a daily basis.
Use Natural, Not Artificial, Sweeteners
To put it frankly, artificial sweeteners are very dangerous for both you and your unborn child. I've written an entire book on the topic of artificial sweeteners, but let me take you through a brief look at these dangerous drugs posing as sweeteners.
After pouring over countless literature from the FDA, plus medical and scientific studies, I am more convinced that ever that artificial sweeteners such as NutraSweet® (aspartame) and Splenda® (sucralose) can ruin your health, and that you should stay away from them. They are present in numerous foods, from baked goods, to yogurt, to soft drinks.
Artificial sweeteners can cause depression, migraines, and even brain tumors.113
A seven-year study on aspartame (also known as NutraSweet® or Equal®) has linked it to high rates of lymphomas, leukemias, and other cancers in rats.114 The rats were given the equivalent of four to five bottles of diet soda a day for a human. The carcinogenic effect of aspartame was found at levels as low as about 20 milligrams a day for humans. This is far less than current daily limits in America, which is 50 milligrams.
And if you are using Splenda® because you think it is a safe alternative to sugar or other artificial sweeteners like Nutrasweet, then you are in for a big surprise. Splenda® is marketed as a ""healthful"" and ""natural"" product since it is derived from sugar, however, its chemical structure is very different from sugar. Sucralose is actually a chemical substance.115
Studies have shown its use has resulted in reduced growth rate in newborns (and adults) at levels above 500 mg/kg.day, decreased red blood cells -- a sign of anemia (at levels above 1500 mg/kd/day), thyroid abnormalities, and aborted pregnancies.116
I think you must realize by now that having a drink or other product sweetened by one of these artificial sweeteners is just not worth the risk to your baby. Nearly every month I receive a report from someone who has had an adverse reaction to Splenda. You can see many of them posted on my site.
Thankfully, there are a few really safe and natural sweeteners on the market today. Stevia and xylitol are both tasty and healthy sweeteners that you can use instead of either sugar or artificial sweeteners. Some people have complained of a metallic, bitter taste to Stevia, but this comes from the processing method.
Check out different brands and you'll see this does not apply to all Stevia products. Stevia is currently available in the United States only as a nutritional supplement, while the FDA reviews its safety.117
It's ironic that although Stevia extract is approved as a food additive in a dozen countries including Japan, Brazil and China, it can only be sold in the U.S. as a dietary supplement. However, compounds from the Stevia plant can be legally used as a ""natural"" sweetener. The no-calorie sweetener Truvia is one such example.118
Truvia is not made from whole Stevia, just two of the sweetest compounds. This raises the question: Is it still safe once you remove all the other compounds inherent in the original plant? So far, no one knows. Therefore I would advise you to avoid sweeteners made from Stevia compounds such as Truvia, until its safety has been ascertained.
Xylitol is another great, all-natural sweetener made from birch trees. Xylitol has been shown to provide health benefit in more ways than just as a sweetener. According to scientific research studies, regular Xylitol consumption can result in fewer cavities, improved gum health,119 a reduction in nasal and sinus infections, and stronger bones.
In studies in Finland in 1994, Xylitol was shown to maintain bone density in rats that had their ovaries surgically removed. Without ovaries, estrogen levels in the rats plummeted, as did the bone density in the rats that were not given Xylitol. However, in the rats that were given Xylitol, bone density actually increased.120
Xylitol also is said to be effective against H. pylori, the microorganism implicated in periodontal disease and gastric ulcers.
Nevertheless, if you struggle with insulin issues, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or extra weight, I suggest you avoid sweeteners altogether. Most sweeteners can also decrease your sensitivity to insulin.
Cleanse Your System with Healthy Water
It's so very important for you to drink pure water, especially if you are pregnant. Avoid tap and distilled water, and choose spring or filtered water.121 Tap water should be avoided because it contains chlorine, arsenic, and frequently fluoride, all toxic substances that can have dire consequences for your baby and you.
Further, researchers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Geological Survey have found traces of antibiotics‚ birth control drugs‚ anti-depressants, and other drugs in many water samples taken across the country.
According to water quality expert Robert Slovak, from the fetus-forming stage of a child up to his or her teens, the sensitivity to the effects of toxic chemicals in water is tens of thousands of times more than in an adult. This means you should be drinking the best possible water to protect your baby, because this is where the damage begins and where it can't be reversed.
Some water has even been found to contain lead.122 In the early 90s, lead was an ingredient in brass. So if you happen to live in a house that still has fixtures from the early 90s, there's a very good chance they are brass. That means you could have lead leaching into your water.
The way this happens is that water sits on these fixtures overnight, and that means it can absorb and dissolve the lead that's in the brass faucets.
And water can dissolve quite an astoundingly high amount of lead, especially if your water has certain aggressive tendencies, such as low pH and low alkalinity. So for the well being of your baby, if you have these pre-1990 fixtures, you should have your tap water tested for lead contamination. A lead test costs about $25.
  An alternative solution, if you simply have no other water option at present, would be to allow the water to run for a few moments first, which can drastically reduce the lead concentration. But until you're sure your water is safe and free from harmful contaminants, you should totally avoid tap water and find a purer source of water.123
In addition, there are two other very dangerous substances in tap water you should be aware of, and these are formed by the municipal water disinfection process itself, according to water quality expert Slovak. These chemicals are trihalomethanes (THMs) and halo acetic acids (HAAs). They are called disinfection byproducts, or DBPs for short.
THMs have been linked to liver, kidney, and nervous system problems, in addition to cancer. The HAAs are primarily related to an increased risk of cancer.
So, removing fluoride, chlorine, DBPs, and some other toxic chemicals from your drinking water are critical requirements for any water, or house water filtration system, that you choose. You need to ensure that it will adequately protect you and your unborn child from the chemicals and pollutants found in tap water.
Complicating matters further, the environmental watchdog group, Natural Resources Defense Council, (NRDC), says there is no easy way to determine whether bottled drinking water is really pure or just rebottled tap water.124 They suggest carefully checking the bottle label and even the cap. If it says ""from a municipal source"" or ""from a community water system,"" this means it's derived from tap water.
Of course, it is still unclear whether or not the water has been refiltered since it left the tap.
And the jury is still out on distilled water as an effective form of water purification, so until more research is done, I would not use it unless no other form of purification is available to you, and only for short term use. Spring water is a good source, if you can be sure that it is as pure as claimed. Some bottled spring water has been found to simply be bottled tap water.125
Charcoal filters are another option, but make sure you read the box carefully, so you know which toxins it filters out. Make sure at very minimum it removes chlorine, fluoride, lead, mercury, and arsenic, and try to choose a filter that meets NSF/ANSI standard 53. While certainly not all-encompassing, this standard gives you some assurance that the filter will at least reduce the levels of some common pollutants.
The pros for carbon filters are that they are simple to install, relatively economical, and depending on micron level, will filter out the most deadly of contaminants, such as Cryptosporidium and Guardia.126
The cons are that carbon filters gather the 'garbage' in your tap water, and the organic component of this garbage is quite capable of rotting. Also, carbon filters may be susceptible to mold attacks if left unused for extended periods. Further, they cannot filter out all possible contaminants, but only those they say they do.
Some charcoal filters are enhanced with activated nano-silver, which provides some extra antibacterial protection, killing around 650 known types of organisms. Also, if sediment is a problem where you live, you should consider adding a second, separate sediment prefilter. Otherwise, if you buy a more expensive charcoal filter, it can become clogged up long before its normal lifespan.
But these filters are not totally effective in filtering out all the contaminants and carcinogens in your water that could cause you harm, so I would suggest, for the health and welfare of your baby, to only use one until you can afford a more effective option, such as a Reverse Osmosis system.
I believe the most complete and sure method for removing toxic elements in your drinking water is a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. This system has the ability to remove both THMs and arsenic from the water, as well as chlorine, fluoride, and a wide array of other additives and contaminants. An RO system probably removes the broadest spectrum of toxins of any water system that I know of.127
This is the same technology used to make the purest bottled water, and it is the only technology capable of desalinating sea water and making it into drinking water The units either fit on top of your kitchen counter, or you can get a unit that goes under your kitchen sink. While RO units generally cost a bit more than most charcoal filters, the water purity makes it well worth the price.
But whatever method of filtration you use, if you store any of your water for later use, be sure to store it in either clear polyethylene or glass containers, because the one-gallon plastic (PVC) containers transfer far too many chemicals into your water.128
Also, if you plan to use baby bottles after your delivery, you will most certainly want to consider using glass bottles in place of plastic ones for similar reasons. Studies have shown that even extremely low levels of a common chemical used in plastics, BPA, produced genetic abnormalities.
BPA has the ability to mimic hormones, and in fact, it was invented in the 1930s during the search for synthetic estrogens, so it is not something you want in your drinking water!

Hopefully, all these tips, plus the other information I have provided here, will help to ensure a safe and happy pregnancy for you and your baby, and will also guarantee that your child has a healthy foundation to grow to full adulthood, able to meet all the challenges that life brings.

"202","https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/11/05/swine-flu-vaccine-ingredients.aspx","November 05, 2009","A Review of Four Approved Swine Flu Vaccines’ Ingredients","By Dr. Mercola
As it stands now, we've spent decades injecting materials into the bodies of young and old alike, without sufficient amounts of safety testing of the ingredients, and our society is showing the signs of this neglect. Neurological dysfunction and disorders such as autism and Alzheimer's have been growing steadily and show no signs of slowing down.
Mercury, in the form of thimerosal, is included in the majority of all flu vaccines as a preservative in multi-dose vials. Thimerosal-free single-dose vials are typically reserved for infants under the age of three, and pregnant women only.
I recently published a long list of studies confirming the health dangers of thimerosal -- proof that those who claim ""thimerosal has never been shown to cause any damage"" are not telling you the truth. There's plenty of evidence to the contrary, and if you missed that article, I recommend you review it now. But thimerosal is not the only questionable and potentially dangerous ingredient in flu vaccines.
Adjuvants Explained
In order for a vaccine to be considered effective, your immune response to the vaccine should be to produce antibodies to the live or dead viruses in the vaccine (the antigen). An adjuvant is a substance added to a vaccine to improve your immune response to the antigen. The word comes from the Latin adjuvare, which means ""to help.""
By adding adjuvants the vaccine can contain less viral antigens, which reduces production costs. Unfortunately, many of these adjuvants are highly toxic. There are several types of adjuvants. Some of the most commonly used ones include:
Aluminium hydroxide
Aluminium phosphate
Calcium phosphate
Other adjuvants include oil-based emulsions such as squalene, Squalene has not been licensed by the FDA for use in vaccines distributed in the U.S. yet, although squalene is an adjuvant used in vaccines distributed in Europe and other countries. GlaxoSmithKline's proprietary formula ASO3™ and Novartis' MF59™ are two examples of squalene adjuvants.
As damaging as the neurotoxin mercury is, it's important to realize that aluminum is also a neurotoxin and aluminum-based adjuvants are estimated to be even MORE toxic than mercury.
GREAT NEWS -- No Squalene Allowed in US Swine Flu Vaccines!
Fortunately, Americans can draw a sigh of relief as it pertains to squalene -- one of the most controversial of the adjuvants -- at least for now.
Although vaccine manufacturers were pushing to be allowed to use squalene in many of the swine flu vaccines, and the US Department of Health and Human Services purchased spent more than $400 million of tax payers' money to stockpile the oil-based adjuvant, their efforts have been unsuccessful so far.
In order to legally allow unlicensed squalene adjuvants to be included in licensed H1N1 vaccines, the US government would have had to issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
There have been small H1N1clinical trials in which experimental squalene adjuvants were included and tested, which have been reported by various media sources, fueling the questions about its use. But that is different from an FDA licensed vaccine that is made available for general public use.
To date, no EUA has been issued, so the swine flu vaccines licensed for use in the US do NOT contain squalene. However, it is still unclear whether the National Emergency declaration issued by President Obama on October 23, 2009, will cover adding novel adjuvants like squalene, or whether a separate EUA must be issued to allow the use of unlicensed adjuvants.
The best way to confirm the existence of vaccine components is to consult the vaccine product manufacturer inserts. Below, you will find links to the inserts for the four H1N1 vaccines licensed for use in the US.
You may also want to review the transcript of the July 23, 2009 meeting of the FDA Vaccines & Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for more information on the discussion about whether the FDA should issue an EUA and allow unlicensed adjuvants in US vaccines.
Thankfully, so far, the FDA has declined to approve squalene adjuvants for US H1N1 vaccines, but that does not mean that the drug companies will not continue to press for approval in the future.
Beware: European Vaccines May Contain Squalene
Unfortunately, vaccine manufacturers have persuaded countries in Europe and elsewhere to add squalene to seasonal influenza and H1N1 vaccines, so if you live outside the US, you will need to do some further research to determine which vaccines may contain squalene.
A recent article in the English version of the German news source The Local, for example, warns that the German Defense Ministry has ordered a special stock of H1N1 vaccines for their troops that will contain neither mercury nor adjuvants, whereas the general public will be given vaccines containing both.
When checking for squalene, beware that the ingredient called MF59™ is an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene, Tween™80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate), and sorbitan trioleate. MF59 is approved for human use in Europe, but not in the U.S.
Four Swine Flu Vaccines have Gained US FDA Approval
Below I will review the list of ingredients for the four swine flu vaccines that gained U.S. FDA approval on September 15. (As of this writing, GlaxoSmithKline is the only contracted vaccine manufacturer that has not yet gotten their swine flu vaccine approved.) Please note that there may be additional anti-virals available that are being used to treat swine flu, and/or swine flu vaccines on the market in other countries, but this article only covers the following four vaccines that have received FDA approval for use in the US:
MedImmune (intranasal spray)
Novartis
Sanofi-Pasteur
CSL
These companies, along with GlaxoSmithKline, have all been awarded contracts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for development and production of more than 195 million doses of swine flu vaccine. For more information, warnings and side effects of each ingredient, please follow the hyperlinks provided.
MedImmune
MedImmune, which is a subsidiary of London-based AstraZeneca, offers an intranasal spray that contains live attenuated virus. The package insert for MedImmune's intranasal vaccine can be found here. Please note that the adverse reaction information for MedImmune's vaccine is based on studies conducted with the seasonal flu version known as FluMist.
Please review the insert for numerous warnings, contraindications, and adverse reactions. Of special note are the warnings that it should not be administrated to children and adolescents (2-17 years of age) receiving aspirin therapy or aspirin-containing therapy, because of association of Reye's syndrome.
In addition, it's important to realize that safety has not been established in individuals with underlying medical conditions predisposing them to influenza complications. MedImmune's vaccine also should not be administered to any individual with asthma, or children under the age of 5 with recurring wheezing because of the potential for increased risk of wheezing post vaccination.
Lastly, please note that some viruses contained in this and other intranasal vaccines CAN spread from the vaccinated person to others. Hence, if a person has a compromised immune system, he or she could be placed at risk of infection from people who have been vaccinated. The ease of transmission appears to vary from strain to strain.
Dosing Instructions for MedImmune Intranasal Spray vaccine:
Children 0-2 years: Not approved
Children 2-9 years: 2 doses, 0.2 ml each, approximately one month apart
Children and adults between the ages of 10-49 years: 1 dose, 0.2 ml
Adults 50-65: Not approved, as FluMist was found to have no demonstrable effectiveness in this age group
Seniors 65 and over: Not approved
Pregnant women: Not recommended
Ingredients include:
Live, attenuated virus
Monosodium glutamate. MSG is a known neurotoxin and excitotoxin.
Egg proteins
Sucrose (table sugar)
Dibasic potassium phosphate
Monobasic potassium phosphate
Gentamicin sulfate (antibiotic)
Intranasal vaccines do not contain thimerosal (mercury).
Questionable Efficacy…
According to the insert, FluMist has demonstrated a mere 44.5 percent reduction in influenza rate when looking at all strains, compared to active controls (other flu vaccines).
Novartis
The package insert for Novartis' Influenza A(H1N1) 2009 Monovalent vaccine can be found here. Again, the adverse reaction information for this swine flu vaccine is based on studies conducted with the seasonal flu vaccine Fluvirin, not the A(H1N1) vaccine itself. It is worth noting that the safety data for Fluvarin (upon which the safety data for the swine flu vaccine is based), was collected from 29 clinical studies over the past 27 years that included no more than 2,768 adults.
In these studies, the subjects were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and were instructed to complete a diary card for the three days following immunization, to collect local and systemic reactions. So, keep in mind that the ""safety data"" for this vaccine is based on studying human subjects for FOUR DAYS. Not weeks, months, or years, to see if problems occur down the line.
Please review the insert for numerous warnings, contraindications, and adverse reactions.
Dosing Instructions (intra-muscular injection):
Children 0-4: Not recommended
Children 4-9: Two 0.5 ml doses one month apart
Children 9-17: One 0.5 ml dose
Adults, 18 and over: One 0.5 ml dose
Ingredients include:
Inactivated A/California/7/2009(H1N1)v-like virus derived from cell-cultures using dog kidneys. Physorg.com http://www.physorg.com/news175767804.html recently reported that a Swiss authority overseeing medicine and therapeutical products had found bacterial contamination in test batches of the vaccine -- a charge that Novartis has denied.
Single-dose vials contain 1 mcg of mercury per 0.5 ml dose
Multi-dose vials contain 25 mcg of mercury per 0.5 ml dose
Egg proteins
Polymyxin (antibiotic)
Neomycin (antibiotic found in many topical medications). Neomycin is in the FDA pregnancy category D. This means that it is known to be harmful to fetuses.
Beta-propiolactone (a disinfectant). According to the EPA: ""No information is available on the chronic (long-term), reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of beta-propiolactone in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified beta-propiolactone as a Group 2B, possible human carcinogen.""
Nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE) (a toxic cleaning agent)
Sanofi-Pasteur
The package insert for Sanofi-Pasteur's Influenza A(H1N1) 2009 Monovalent vaccine can be found here. The adverse reaction information for Sanofi-Pasteur's vaccine is based on studies conducted with the seasonal flu version known as Fluzone. The safety data for infants under the age of 3 is based on adverse reactions of 19 children, reported within a mere three days of vaccination.
Please review the insert for numerous warnings, contraindications, and adverse reactions.
Dosing Instructions (intra-muscular injection):
Children 0-5 months: Not approved
Children 6-35 months: two 0.25 ml doses, approximately one month apart
Children 36 months to 9 years: two 0.5 ml doses, approximately one month apart
Children 10 years and older: one 0.5 ml dose
Adults: one 0.5 ml dose
Ingredients include:
Inactivated A/California/7/2009(H1N1)v-like virus propagated in embryonated chicken eggs
Prefilled pediatric syringes and single-dose vials are mercury-free
Multi-dose vials contain 25 mcg of mercury per 0.5 ml dose
Formaldehyde (up to 100 mcg). Formaldehyde is classifed as a probable human carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and as a known human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
Triton-X 100 (Polyethylene glycol P-isooctylphenyl ether) is a toxic detergent
Sodium phosphate
Sodium chloride (table salt)
Gelatin
Sucrose (table sugar)
CSL Biotherapies, Inc.
The package insert for CSL's Influenza A(H1N1) 2009 Monovalent vaccine can be found here. The adverse reaction information for CSL's vaccine is based on studies conducted with the seasonal flu version known as Afluria.
Here the safety data is based on adverse reactions reported within 21 days of vaccination. It's also worth noting that the safety assessment studies were done using mercury-containing placebos, which may significantly skew the data as the control group would most likely experience similar side effects of the thimerosal as those receiving the actual vaccine.
Additionally, tucked away on page 10 it states that:
""No controlled clinical studies demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Afluria have been performed.""
Please review the insert for numerous warnings, contraindications, and adverse reactions.
Dosing Instructions (intra-muscular injection):
Adults only, 18 years and older: one 0.5 ml dose
Ingredients include:
Inactivated A/California/7/2009(H1N1)v-like virus propagated in embryonated chicken eggs
Single-dose vials are mercury-free
Multi-dose vials contain 24.5 mcg of mercury per 0.5 ml dose
Polymyxin (antibiotic)
Neomycin (antibiotic found in many topical medications). Neomycin is in the FDA pregnancy category D. This means that it is known to be harmful to fetuses.
Sodium chloride (table salt)
Monobasic sodium phosphate
Dibasic sodium phosphate
Monobasic potassium phosphate
Potassium chloride
Calcium chloride
Sodium taurodeoxycholate (detergent)
Egg proteins (ovalbumin)
Beta-propiolactone (a disinfectant). According to the EPA: ""No information is available on the chronic (long-term), reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of beta-propiolactone in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified beta-propiolactone as a Group 2B, possible human carcinogen.""
How Effective is the H1N1 Vaccine, Really?
""Specific levels of HI antibody titers post-vaccination with inactivated influenza virus vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus. In some human studies, antibody titers of 1:40 or greater have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects.""
You will find that paragraph in all the vaccine inserts. What that paragraph says, is that the vaccine only works in half, or less, of those individuals who attain the specified level of seroconversion after vaccination. The FDA defines seroconversion as achieving an antibody titer of 1:40.
This means that if a vaccine was 100 percent effective at achieving this level of seroconversion, it would protect up to 50 percent of the recipients of the vaccine. But none of the vaccines are 100 percent effective at achieving seroconversion.
CSL's vaccine insert, for example, (see pages 11-12), states that their H1N1 vaccine provides seroconversion for:
48.7 percent of people aged 18-65
34 percent for seniors, 65 and older
That means that, at best, their vaccine works in one out of every four people! (49 percent of 50 percent). Which, of course, means that the vaccine does NOT work in three out of every four people…
Is it REALLY worth it?

Truly fresh orange juice only lasts a few days. It if last for weeks (or months), it's an industrial product.
Until the Florida orange growers launched a campaign in the early 20th century to deal with their surplus crop, the only people who drank orange juice were Floridians who had a tree in their backyard.

What experience and history teach is this -- that people and governments never have learned anything from history or acted on principles deduced from it.” G.W.F. Hegel
I have been following the evolving “pandemic” of H1N1 influenza beginning with the original discovery of the infection in Mexico in March of this year. In the course of this study I have tried to utilize as my sources high-quality, peer-reviewed journals, data from the CDC and accepted textbooks of virology.
As with all such studies one has to integrate and correlate previous experiences with epidemics and pandemics. As you will see, a great deal of my material comes from official sources, such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the New England Journal of Medicine. Thus my distracters cannot claim that I am using material that is not within the mainstream.
Pregnant Women NOT at Special Risk from Swine Flu
In the beginning, even before it was declared a level 6 pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), a group of “scientists” were sounding the alarm that this might indeed be the terrifying, deadly pandemic they had been expecting for over half a century.
Naturally, the vaccine manufacturers were doing all they could to fuel this fear and they were quietly making deals with WHO to be among the companies selected to manufacture the “pandemic” vaccine for the world. Being anointed by WHO would guarantee tens of billions in profits.
As the infection began to spread into the United States and then the rest of the world, its peculiar nature became obvious. Those born before 1950 seem to have a high degree of resistance to the infection and the disease seems slightly more pathogenic (disease causing) among those aged 25 to 49. Early on the official sources declared that pregnant women were at a special risk as compared to the seasonal flu.1 As we shall see later, this was a grand lie.
Initial Studies Show H1N1 NOT Dangerous or Highly Contagious
Once the pandemic had been declared, virologists tested the potency of this virus using a conventional method, that is, infecting ferrets with the virus.2 What they found was that the H1N1 virus was no more pathogenic than the ordinary seasonal flu, even though it did penetrate slightly deeper into the lungs. It in no way matched the pathogenecity of the 1917-1918 H1N1 virus. It also did not infect other tissues, and especially important, it did not infect the brain.
Next, they wanted to test the ability of the virus to spread among the population. The results of their tests were conflicting, but the best evidence indicated that the virus did not spread to others very well. In fact, an unpublished study by the CDC found that when one member of a family contracted the H1N1 virus, other members of the family were infected only 10% of the time -- a very low communicability.
This was later confirmed in a study of the experience of New York State, in which only 6.9% of the population contracted the virus, far below the 50% predicted by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.3 It is instructive to note that during the 1917-18 Swine flu epidemic the world infection rate was only 20%.4
They also predicted that 1.8 million people would need hospitalization and 300,000 would end up in the intensive care units (ICU). Further, they predicted that hospitals would be overwhelmed and that ICU units would not have enough beds to care for the sick and dying. Incredibly, they predicted that 90,000 people would die.
Much Fear Mongering
Not satisfied, they up the ante on fear mongering by peddling the idea that pregnant women were especially in danger as were small children. We were told daily that young, healthy people were dying, not just those with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other immune suppressive diseases. The Minister of Fear (the CDC) was working overtime peddling doom and gloom, knowing that frightened people do not make rational decisions -- nothing sells vaccines like panic.
These same dire predictions were extended to Australia and New Zealand, which began to show an increase in their reported cases of H1N1 and associated hospitalizations as they entered their fall and winter. Recently, two major articles were released in the New England Journal of Medicine, which analyzed the American hospitalization experience5 and the Australian/New Zealand ICU experience6. I will analyze these very interesting studies.
There is a dramatic disconnect between what the science is discovering about this flu virus and what is being broadcast over the media outlets. As you will see, this is a very mild flu virus infection for 99.9% of the population.
Australian and New Zealand Experience Prove U.S. is Wrong
As I stated, the countries in the southern hemisphere have already gone through their fall and winter, that is the seasons of peak flu infections. Epidemiologists and virologists have been surprised at how mild this flu pandemic has been in the Southern Hemisphere, with relatively few deaths and few hospitalizations in most areas.
The study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine on October 8, 2009, called the AZIC study, analyzed all ICU admissions in New Zealand and Australia, looking at a number of factors.6 Here is what they found.
ICU Hospitalizations
Out of a population of 25 million people, 722 were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a confirmed diagnosis of H1N1 influenza. Overall, 856 people were admitted with a flu virus, but 11.3% were a type A flu that was not subtyped and 4.3% were seasonal flu.
They also analyzed the number of people admitted with viral pneumonia and found the following:
Number of People Admitted to the Hospital each Year with Viral Pneumonia5
57 people in 2005
33 people in 2006
69 people in 2007
69 people in 2008
37 people in 2009
So we see that in 2009 they had 32 fewer people admitted with actual viral pneumonia. The CDC and other public health agents of fear like to imply that mass numbers of people are dying from “flu”, that is, actual influenza viral pneumonia, when in fact, most are dying from other complications secondary to underlying health problems -- either diagnosed or undiagnosed.
They also found that the average person’s risk of ending up in the ICU was one in 35,714 or about three thousandths of one percent (0.00285%), an incredibly low risk. When they looked at actual admission to the ICU, they found that it was people aged 25 to 49 who made up the largest number admitted. Infants from birth to age 1 year had the higher admission per population, and had a high mortality rate.
Majority of Children Respond POORLY to Flu Vaccine
It is interesting to note that babies this age respond poorly to either the seasonal flu vaccine or the H1N1 vaccine. One of the largest studies ever done, found that children below the age of 2 years received no protection at all from the seasonal flu vaccine.7
The recently completed study on the effectiveness of the new H1N1 vaccine reported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease found that 75% of small children below age 35 months received no protection from the H1N1 vaccine and that 65% of children between the ages of 3 years and 9 years received no protection from the vaccine.8
Flu Vaccine DOUBLES Risk of Getting H1N1
It is also important to view this in the face of the new unpublished Canadian study of 12 million people that found getting the seasonal flu vaccine, as recommended by the CDC and NIH, doubles one’s risk of developing the H1N1 infection. It would also make the infection much more serious. So much for expert advice from the government.
Obese at Six Times Higher Risk from H1N1 Complications
As stated, most authorities agree that the H1N1 variant virus is quite mild as far as flu viruses go. The vast majority of people (99.99%) are having very brief and mild illnesses from this virus.
Keep in mind that when I am discussing numbers and risk, this does not intend to understate the devastation experienced by the people who are experiencing serious illness or even death.
Any death is a tragedy.
What we are discussing here is -- is the risk from this virus significant enough to justify draconian measures by the government and medical community? Should we implement mass vaccinations with a vaccine that is essentially an experimental vaccine, poorly tested and of questionable benefit?
The study also looked at the health risk of the people admitted to the ICU, but unfortunately did not look at the underlying health problems of those who died. We get a hint, since the American study did note that it was those over age 65 who were most likely to die, and that 100% of these individual had underlying health problems before they were infected.
One of the real surprises from this study, and the American study, was that one of the more powerful risk factors for being admitted to the ICU and of dying was obesity. Obese people are admitted 6x more often than those of normal weight. As we shall see, obesity played a significant role in the risk to children and pregnant women as well, something that has never been discussed by the media, the CDC or the public health officials.
This study found that 32.7% of those admitted to the ICU had asthma or other chronic pulmonary disease, far higher than the general population. The Australian and New Zealand study also had a large number of aboriginal patients and those from the Torres Strait. It is known that nutrient deficiencies are common in both populations, which means an impaired immune system.
Obesity is associated with a high incidence of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, both of which would increase one’s risk of having a serious infection, even to viruses that are mildly pathogenic. (mild viruses).
H1N1 Vaccine is NOT Made the Same as Regular Flu Vaccine!!
I am really upset at the insistence by the CDC, medical doctors and the media that all pregnant women should be vaccinated by this experimental vaccine. The media repeats the manufacturers’ mantra that this vaccine is produced exactly like the seasonal flu, when in fact it is not. Yes, they use chicken eggs, but the rest has been fast tracked and many shortcuts on safety procedures have been allowed.
There are 250,000 pregnant women in Australia and New Zealand combined. Only 66 pregnant women were admitted to the ICU, an incidence of 1 pregnant woman per 3,800 pregnant women or a risk of .03%.6 Put another way, a pregnant woman in these two countries can feel comfortable to know that there is a 99.97% chance that she will not get sick enough to end up in the ICU.
Pregnant Women NOT at Increased Risk, Obese Women Are!!
So, why did even 66 pregnant women end up in the ICU? As we shall see in the American study5, a significant number of these pregnant women were either obese or morbidly obese and most had underlying medical problems. The Australian/New Zealand study6 found that one of the major risk factors for pregnant women was indeed being obese and that obesity was associated with a high risk of underlying medical disorders.
They also found that death from H1N1 infection correlated best with increasing age, contrary to what the media says. They concluded the study with the following statement:
“ The proportion of patients who died in the hospital in our study is no higher than that previously reported among patients with seasonal influenza A who were admitted to the ICU.” 6
In fact, they report that of those infected with the H1N1 variant virus who were sick enough to be admitted to the ICU, 84.5 % went home and 14.3% died and that of those admitted with seasonal flu 72.9% were discharged and 16.2% died. That is, more died from the seasonal flu.
Recent NEJM Study of the American Experience
In the same Oct, 8th issue of the New England Journal of Medicine they reported on the American experience with the H1N1 variant virus.5 The study looked at data from 24 states with widespread influenza infection from April through June 2009. Remember, unlike most flu epidemics in the United States, this epidemic began early and by the end of September it was beginning to peak, with late October being the date it may begin to decline.
The study examined 13,217 cases of infection involving 1082 people who were hospitalized. Here is what they found:
Underlying Medical Conditions
Of the total hospitalized patients:
60% of children had underlying medical conditions
83% of adults had underlying medical conditions
They also found that 32% of patients had at least 2 medical conditions that would put them at risk. We are constantly told that it is the young adult aged 25 to 49 who is at the greatest risk. Note that 83% of these people had underlying medical conditions. This means that in truth only 292 “healthy” people out of 1082 in 24 states were sick enough to enter the hospital -- that is 292 healthy people out of tens of millions of people, not much of a risk if you do not have an underlying chronic medical problem.
Underlying Medical Conditions Risk Factor for H1N1 Deaths
When they looked at people over age 65 years of age, that is, the folks who are most likely to die in the hospital, 100% had underlying medical conditions -- all of them. So, there was not one healthy person over age 65 who has died out of 24 states combined.
What about the children, a special target of the fear mongering media and government agencies? This study found that 60% had underlying medical conditions and that 30% were either obese or morbidly obese.

A previous CDC study states that 2/3 of children who died had neurological disorders or respiratory diseases such as asthma.3 If we take the 60% figure, that means out of the 84 children reported to have died by October 24th, 2009, only 34 children considered healthy in a nation of 301 million people really died, not 84. It is also instructive to note that according to CDC figures, the seasonal flu last year killed 116 children.9
Remember, that is, 34 so-called healthy children out of a nation of 40 million children. In 2003 it was reported by the CDC that 90 children died from seasonal flu complications. Ironically, as shown by Neil Z. Miller in his excellent book -- Vaccine Safety Manuel -- once the flu vaccine was given to small children the death rate from flu increased 7-fold.10 Not surprising, since the mercury in the vaccine suppresses immunity.
Pediatric Flu Deaths by Year Made WORSE by Flu Vaccine
1999 -- - 29 deaths
2000 -- - 19 deaths
2001 -- - 13 deaths
2002 -- - 12 deaths
2003 -- - 90 deaths (Year of mass vaccinations of children under age 5 years)
2006 -- 78 deaths
2007 -- - 88 deaths
2008 – 116 deaths (40.9% vaccinated at age 6 months to 23 months)11
Parents should also keep in mind that this study, as well as the Australian/New Zealand Study found that childhood obesity played a major role in a child’s risk of being admitted to the ICU or dying. This is another dramatic demonstration as to the danger of obesity in children and that all parents should avoid MSG (all food-based excitotoxin additives), excess sugar and excess high glycemic carbohydrates in their children’s diets. This goes for pregnant moms as well.
Every Parent Needs to Know Other Vaccines INCREASE Risk of H1N1
One major factor being left out of all discussion of these vaccines, especially those for small children and babies, is the effect of other vaccinations on presently circulating viral infections such as the H1N1 variant virus. It is known that several of the vaccines are powerfully immune suppressing. For example, the measles, mumps and rubella virus are all immune suppressing, as seen with the MMR vaccine, a live virus vaccine.12, 13
This means that when a child receives the MMR vaccine, for about two to five weeks afterwards their immune system is suppressed, making them highly susceptible to catching viruses and bacterial infections circulating through the population. Very few mothers are ever told this, even though it is well accepted in the medical literature.
In fact, it is known that the Hib vaccine for haemophilus influenzae is an immune suppressing vaccine and that vaccinated children are at a higher risk of developing haemophilus influenzae meningitis for at least one week after receiving the vaccine.10,14 These small children receive both of these vaccines.
According to the vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC and used by most states, a child will receive their MMR vaccine and Hib vaccine at one year of age and both are immune suppressing.

At age 2 to 4 months, they will receive a Hib vaccine. Therefore at age 2 to 4 months, and again at age one year, they are at an extreme risk of serious infectious complications caused by vaccine-induced immune suppression. The New Zealand/Australian study found that the highest death in the young was from birth to age 12 months, the very time they were getting these immune-suppressing vaccines.6
The so-called healthy children and babies that have ended up in the hospital and have died may in fact be the victims of immune suppression caused by their routine childhood vaccines. We may never know because the medical elite will never record such data or conduct the necessary studies. Recall also that the seasonal flu vaccine, which is recommended for all children over the age of 6 months, each year, is also immune suppressing because of the mercury-containing thimerosal in the vaccine.15

Infants under the age of 3 receive mercury-free seasonal flu vaccines, but any child over the age of 3 will receive the mercury-containing flu vaccine year after year. (Each dose of seasonal flu vaccine typically containing 25 mcg of mercury.)
If parents allow their children to be vaccinated according to the CDC recommendations, that is 2 seasonal flu vaccines and 2 swine flu vaccines as well as a pneumococcal vaccine, that will increase the number of vaccines a child will have by age 6 years to 41. This amounts to an enormous amount of aluminum and mercury as well as intense brain inflammation triggered by vaccine-induced microglial activation.16
Risk of Serious Illness from the H1N1 Mutant Virus
Their survey of 24 states found that a total of 67 patients out of tens of millions of people ended up in the ICU. That is, only 6% of the people admitted to the hospital were so sick as to need intensive treatments. Of these 67 patients, 19 died (25%) and of these 67% had obvious underlying long-term medical illnesses. This means that only 6 patients out of tens of millions of people in 24 states that were considered “healthy” before their infection, had died. Is this justification for a mass vaccination campaign?
Of the 1082 hospitalized patients, 93% were eventually discharged recovered and only 7% died, a very low death rate. Their analysis of these cases concluded that those who died fell in three categories:
They were older patients
Antiviral medications were started 48 hours after the onset of the illness
There was no correlation to having had seasonal vaccines
The last item is especially interesting because they assume that having had seasonal flu vaccine would have offered some protection -- it offered none.
What they did find was that none who died had been given antiviral medications (Tamiflu or Relenza) within 48 hours of getting sick. Those given the antiviral medications within the golden 48-hour period rarely died. Relenza is far safer than Tamiflu. This was the only factor found to correlate with survival of severely ill ICU patients.
What about the Danger to Pregnant Women? The American Experience
Our media is inundating the public with scare stories of the danger this virus poses to pregnant women. Most of us visualize the pregnant woman as being healthy, young and without underlying medical diseases. The study is quite revealing, but omits some very important factors.
We are told that pregnant women are 6x more likely to end up in the hospital than the general population. This figure is derived from the fact that it was estimated that pregnant women had a 7% greater chance of requiring hospital admission than did the general public at 1% (Even this is a far higher number than their own studies indicate -- actually it is a very small fraction of 1%).
Dr. Michael Bronze, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, writing for emedicine medscape.com (WebMD), states that the risk of a pregnant women being hospitalized with the H1N1 infection is 0.32 per 100,000 pregnant women (which is 1 in 300,000 pregnant women).17 One can safely say, based on the Australian/New Zealand experience (at the peak of their flu season) and the American data somewhere in the middle of their flu season, that pregnant women have about a 99.97% chance they will not become so sick as to require hospital care at any level.
The death rate of pregnant women who were admitted to the ICU was 7.7%, a fairly low figure for infectious ICU patients. Remember, most patients admitted to the hospital are admitted for hydration and are not that ill in terms of the infection itself.
Smoking and Obesity Increase Risk of H1N!
Now, most of us assume that these pregnant women are perfectly healthy as mentioned above, but the data shows something quite different. They found that greater than 30% of the pregnant women were either obese or morbidly obese, as did the Australian/New Zealand study. Of these, 60% had underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk of overwhelming infections -- both viral and bacterial.
It is unfortunate that they did not enter any information on smoking, either by the mother or by anyone living in the household. It is known that smoking greatly increases ones risk of severe complications from any flu virus.18,19 This is for several reasons. One, smokers eat a much poorer diet than non-smokers.
Second, smoking destroys the cilia in the bronchial passageways that are essential for clearing mucus and debris -- thus increasing the risk of developing pneumonia.20 Finally, nicotine is a very powerful immune suppressant.21 The combined effect of all three is enough to land anyone in the ICU during even a mild flu season. Likewise, chronic smokers have low magnesium levels, which increase their risk of developing bronchiospasm that is resistant to normal drug treatments.22-24
They also failed to record possible illegal drug use, how many were living at poverty levels and how many were on prescription drugs known to suppress immunity or deplete nutrients essential for immune function. And, one must keep in mind, at this age, (age range of 15 to 39 years) many would have had numerous childhood vaccines and booster vaccines.

This was also not considered for obvious reasons. So, some critical information we all need to evaluate this “pandemic” is being excluded or purposely kept from us.
Bacterial Pneumonia and Swine Flu
The American study found that of the people admitted to the hospital, 40% were found to have X-ray evidence of pneumonia. Of these, 66% had pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immunosuppression for transplants or cancer or neurologic disorder.
We are not told how many were smokers or lived with smokers, again, something that puts people at great risk of having severe reactions to any infection. Smokers have much higher bacterial pneumonia rates every year. The CDC estimates that smokers have a 200% increased risk of flu virus complications as compared to nonsmokers.
The CDC released in the September 29 issue of the MMWR an analysis of the lung tissue from 77 fatal cases of H1N1 infection.25 Of these, 29% had a secondary bacterial infection -- pneumonia. This is an important study because the media and the CDC are telling adults they need to get a pneumococcal vaccine and that parents need to have their children vaccinated with the pneumococcal vaccine as well.
This adult study found that only half of the pneumonias were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, the organism used in the vaccine. Half of the cases were due to other strains of streptococcus, staphlococcus or H. Influenza. Some 18% of the people had multiple organism cultured from their lungs.
It is important to note that they found that all of these autopsied patients had previous, serious medical problems prior to becoming infected with H1N1 variant and that not all bacteria were examined, meaning that even those with Strep pneumoniae could have had multiple infections, for which the vaccines would have offered no protection.
Parents should also know that the vast majority of pneumonias found in these infected children were not due to Strep pneumoniae, but rather Staph aureus. Again, the pneumococcal vaccine would have offered these children no protection.
Pregnant Women Given Vaccine Have Babies with More Health Problems
It has always been a principle of medicine that one should not vaccinate pregnant women, except in extreme cases, because the risk to the baby is too high. Recently, we have seen two examples of violation of this policy. When the HPV vaccine Gardasil was first released the CDC and the manufacturer (Merck Pharmaceutical Company) recommended that it be given to pregnant women.
Shortly after beginning this dangerous practice it was ordered halted because a number of women were losing their babies and babies were being born with major malformations.26
It is known that stimulating a woman’s immune system during midterm and later term pregnancy significantly increases the risk that her baby will develop autism during childhood and schizophrenia sometime during the teenage years and afterward.27
Compelling scientific evidence also shows an increased risk of seizures in the baby and later as an adult.28 In fact, a number of neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems can occur in babies born to women immunologically stimulated during pregnancy.29-32
It is true that serious flu infections or E. coli infections during pregnancy are a major risk for all these complications, but a woman’s risk of becoming infected, as we have seen, is a very small fraction of 1 %, yet they are calling for all pregnant women to be vaccinated with at least three vaccines, two of which contain mercury. There is also evidence to show that a large number of these women will gain no protection from the vaccine.
Dr. Bronze, quoted above, notes that animal studies have shown that vaccines harm unborn babies and that no safety studies have been done in humans. A recent study done by Dr. Laura Hewitson, a professor of obstetrics at the University of Pittsburg Medical Center, found that a single vaccine used in human babies, when used in newborn monkeys, caused significant abnormalities in brainstem development.33 This mass vaccination program for H1N1 variant virus will be the largest experiment on pregnant women in history and could end as a monumental disaster.
How Many Cases are Really Swine Flu?
CBS, to their credit, conducted a three-month long investigation that indicates that we have all been hoodwinked by the governmental “protection” agency called euphemistically, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.34
What they tried to learn from the CDC was just what percentage of the “flu cases” were in fact H1N1. The CDC did all they could to protect this information and only after filing a Freedom of Information request and waiting 2 months did they finally release the data. Now we know why they wanted it protected and why they stopped testing for the H1N1 virus in late July.
The data revealed that in fact very few cases reported as swine flu were in fact H1N1 variant virus. CBS examined the data in all 50 states. What they found, for example, was that in Georgia only 2% of reported cases were H1N1 (97% negative for H1N1); in Alaska only 1% of reported cases were H1N1 (93% negative for flu and 5% seasonal flu) and in California only 2% of reported cases were H1N1 with 12% being other flu viruses and 86% negative for flu.
A recent release from the CDC found that their survey reported that of 12,943 specimens tested from around the country, only 26.3% of cases tested positive for H1N1 variant virus, but that 99.8% of the specimens tested positive for some type of other flu virus, most of which were regular seasonal flu.
The CDC has now changed all data reporting on the flu effects. They did this by stopping viral typing and subtyping and rolled back all previous numbers based on prior data. The new system for collecting data now started on August 30th, 2009.
The only reason I can imagine they did this is that the prior data was clearly demonstrating that the H1N1 variant virus was causing a very mild illness in most people (99.99%) with fewer hospitalizations, fewer cases of pneumonia and fewer deaths for all ages and groups than the prior seasonal flu in past years. This was true for the United States and the Southern Hemisphere, which has gone though the worst of its flu season.
Now that they are no longer typing the virus, they can attribute all cases of pneumonia, hospitalizations and deaths to H1N1, even though the majority of cases appear to be from a long list of other causes. In fact, they can classify many cases of primary pneumonia as caused by H1N1.
Actually LESS Flu Deaths this Year
One must always keep in mind that the CDC has told us that 36,000 people die every year from influenza and influenza-related complications. Thus far, we have seen (accepting their data) about 900 deaths and 21,829 cases of pneumonia.
This is far below the 36,000 figure. In fact, perhaps we should be breathing a sigh of relief that 35,000 fewer people have died this year from flu-related disorders. This would go down on record as the fewest flu-related deaths in recorded history.

In fact, worldwide, according to CDC and WHO data, far fewer people have died form H1N1 than any seasonal flu in the past. This graph from the CDC showing the ""Pneumonia and Influenza Mortality for 122 US Cities"" also show that, so far, this year's flu mortality is far below that of 2008.
In fact, worldwide, according to CDC and WHO data, far fewer people have died form H1N1 than any seasonal flu in the past. So, one must ask, why is the government and their handmaidens, the media, fueling this panic mentality? Why are we once again talking about mandatory vaccination for every man woman and child in the nation?
And I can assure you that soon we will hear an announcement that the adjuvant MF-59 or ASO3 (squalene) will be needed to save lives.
Now, if the CBS data forced from the files of the CDC is correct, why are so many people dying from this flu? The answer is that no greater number are dying now, for any age group, sex or state of pregnancy than have died in any previous flu outbreak.
By statistical slight of hand they have created this pandemic and continue to do so. One cannot foretell the future, but based on the data now available from the United States, Canada, Europe and the Southern hemisphere, there is no justification for the fear mongering by the media and government agencies.
It is accepted that the cognitive portions of the human brain work less well under two conditions -- fear and anger. Those who have survived deadly situations or who make their living surviving such situations tell us that controlling our fear is the most important thing in survival. More people have died from making poor decisions while overwhelmed by fear than have died as a result of the situation itself.
I am reminded of the poor elderly person who died several years back waiting in a very long line for a flu vaccine in the sweltering heat. It seems she passed out and struck her head on the hard asphalt.
She was standing in that line for hours because the CDC announced that that year’s flu was going to be especially deadly for the elderly and there was a shortage of vaccine. As it turned out, that year they picked the wrong virus to make the vaccine -- so it was not only a dangerous vaccine, it would have given her no protection. But then, the vaccine manufactures got their blood money.
What Do They Not Know About This Vaccine?
Insurance companies in Australia would not insure doctors who gave the vaccine because it was a fast tracked vaccine and therefore experimental. They felt that the danger of complications was far too high to risk insuring the doctors. Unlike doctors in America, they did not have a special law that Congress would pass to insulate them from liability should severe complications arise from the vaccine.
It is also of special interest to note that tens of millions of babies were vaccinated with the Hepatitis B vaccine (providing no protection to the babies) only to learn later that it is linked to a 310% increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis.36 One has to ask -- What else do they not know about this vaccine?
Well, it turns out a lot.
Years after it was added to the recommended vaccine schedule, it was linked to a terrifying disorder called macrophagic myofascitis, which in children is associated with a severe dementia-like illness.
Then we have the case of the Gardasil vaccine. Millions of young girls were vaccinated and within several months pregnant women were losing their babies, babies were being born deformed, several of these very young girls died and a growing number have had serious reactions to the vaccine. Once again we have to ask -- What else do they not know about this vaccine?
Vaccine Safety Testing Only Done for ONE Week
Now we are being told that this new fast tracked, poorly tested vaccine is very safe and effective. The results of the testing on this vaccine were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.39 It is instructive to learn that the tests for safety and to assess complications lasted only 7 days after the vaccine, an incredibly short period of follow-up. Guillain-Barre paralysis can occur even months after a vaccine as can seizures, behavioral problems and neurodevelopmental disorders in children.
It is interesting to note that the authors of the safety study for our swine flu vaccine were all employees of the maker of the vaccine CSL Biotherapeutics and eight held equity interest in the company.39 This admission is part of the disclosure policy of the New England Journal of Medicine.
It is always important to keep in mind when you hear about this vaccine being safe and produced just like the seasonal flu vaccine -- What else do they not know about this vaccine that they will discover months, years or even decades later. Once injected with the vaccine and you develop a complication there will be little that can be done to treat the life-long degenerative disorder it produces. You will just be a sad story on 60 minutes.

The expert: Fredrick vom Saal, PhD, an endocrinologist at the University of Missouri who studies bisphenol-A
The resin linings of tin cans contain bisphenol-A, a synthetic estrogen that has been linked to ailments ranging from reproductive problems to heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Acidity -- a prominent characteristic of tomatoes -- causes BPA to leach into your food.
2. Corn-Fed Beef
The expert: Joel Salatin, co-owner of Polyface Farms and author of books on sustainable farming
Cattle were designed to eat grass, not grains. But farmers today feed their animals corn and soybeans, which fatten up the animals faster for slaughter. A recent comprehensive study found that compared with corn-fed beef, grass-fed beef is higher in beta-carotene, vitamin E, omega-3s, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), calcium, magnesium, and potassium.
3. Microwave Popcorn
The expert: Olga Naidenko, PhD, a senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group
Chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), in the lining of the bag, are part of a class of compounds that may be linked to infertility in humans. In animal testing, the chemicals cause liver, testicular, and pancreatic cancer. Studies show that microwaving causes the chemicals to vaporize -- and migrate into your popcorn.
4. Nonorganic Potatoes
The expert: Jeffrey Moyer, chair of the National Organic Standards Board
Root vegetables absorb herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides that wind up in soil. In the case of potatoes they're treated with fungicides during the growing season, then sprayed with herbicides to kill off the fibrous vines before harvesting. After they're dug up, the potatoes are treated yet again to prevent them from sprouting.
5. Farmed Salmon
The expert: David Carpenter, MD, director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University at Albany
Nature didn't intend for salmon to be crammed into pens and fed soy, poultry litter, and hydrolyzed chicken feathers. As a result, farmed salmon is lower in vitamin D and higher in contaminants, including carcinogens, PCBs, brominated flame retardants, and pesticides such as dioxin and DDT.
6. Milk Produced with Artificial Hormones
The expert: Rick North, project director of the Campaign for Safe Food at the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility
Milk producers treat their dairy cattle with recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH or rBST, as it is also known) to boost milk production. But rBGH also increases udder infections and even pus in the milk. It also leads to higher levels of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor in milk. In people, high levels of IGF-1 may contribute to breast, prostate, and colon cancers.
7. Conventional Apples

Trans fats, found largely in commercially prepared baked and fried foods, have become notorious in recent years because they not only raise ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, but also lower levels of heart-healthy HDL cholesterol.  High trans-fat intake has been linked to coronary heart disease, in which fatty plaques build up in the heart arteries, sometimes leading to a heart attack.
In a new study, researchers found that among nearly 87,000 U.S. women followed for 26 years, trans fat intake was linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death among women who had underlying coronary heart disease. In this group, women who ate the most trans fats were three times more likely to die of cardiac arrest."

Overweight people are defined as having a BMI of between 25 and 30, and obese people of 30 or more, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared. Waist circumference measurements in men were defined as between 94 and 101.9 cm for overweight and more than 102 cm for obese. In women these measurements were 80-87.9 cm for overweight and more than 88 cm for obese."

Influenza has a viral origin and often results in an acute respiratory illness affecting the lower or upper parts respiratory tract, or both. Viruses are mainly of two subtypes (A or B) and spread periodically during the autumn-winter months. Many other viruses however, can also cause illness of the respiratory tract.
Public health efforts to contain the virus rely mainly on widespread vaccination. Recent policy from several internationally-recognized institutions recommends immunization of healthy children from the age of six months and up.
In their 2008 update of a review done in 2006, Cochrane authors found a marked difference between vaccine “efficacy” versus their effectiveness.
Although these two terms are oftentimes used interchangeably in daily conversation, when used in a medical context they confer two different meanings.
“Efficacy” means the extent to which a specific intervention produces a therapeutic effect, or a beneficial result under ideal conditions. The protective efficacy of a vaccine is determined on what is called “antibody titer”.
A simplified explanation is that the antibody titer is a measurement of the amount of antibodies produced in your body that recognize a particular antigen (virus).
“Effectiveness,” on the other hand, shows the intervention’s capacity for producing the intended or expected result. In the case of a flu vaccine, the intended result would be considered its capacity to prevent influenza illness.

Efficacy of 82 percent compared with placebo or no intervention

If you are not already one in three U.S. adults with high blood pressure, the odds are that without intervention, you will be, at some point in your life.
In fact, the risk of becoming hypertensive is greater than 90 percent for indi­viduals in developed countries, according to an editorial in the Lancet.[1]
The medical term for high blood pressure is hypertension. Many confuse this and believe this is high blood pressure related to being tense or anxious. While this can certainly cause high blood pressure in some, anxiety is a relatively minor cause of this condition.
It’s really no surprise that hypertension is on the rise.
In fact, it’s to be expected when the diet of choice -- or sometimes prescribed diet --for so many is some variety of a high grain, low fat regimen. This is exactly the wrong nutritional combination if you have high blood pressure, or if you are hoping to prevent the condition.
The Sugar Connection
Groundbreaking research published in 1998 in the journal Diabetes reported that nearly two-thirds of the test subjects who were insulin resistant (IR) also had high blood pressure.
This crucial connection between IR and hypertension is yet another example of how wide-ranging the debilitating effects of high insulin, leptin and blood glucose levels can have on your body.
Additional research revealed that if your blood pressure doesn’t drop notably overnight, you run an increased risk of having cardiovascular problems. Here, the connection is also elevated blood sugar (glucose) levels. Elevated blood sugars can result in diabetes and other diseases which increase cardiovascular problems.
Chances are if you have hypertension, you also have poorly controlled blood sugar levels. The two problems often go hand in hand. And if your hypertension is the direct result of an out-of-control blood sugar level, then getting your blood sugars normalized will also bring your blood pressure readings into the healthy range.
Healthy Blood Pressure is Within Your Control
Uncontrolled high blood pressure is a very serious health concern that can cause heart disease and increase your risk of having a stroke. It is especially danger­ous because hypertension often has no warning signs or symptoms.
The sad reality is, over half of people taking multiple medications for high blood pressure are still not able to manage their condition.
The great news is that over 85 percent of those who have hypertension can normalize their blood pressure through lifestyle modifications. If you have hypertension or hope to avoid it, there are simple steps you can take to balance your blood pressure, glucose, leptin, and insulin levels -- all at the same time -- without harmful and/or ineffective medications.
I’ll detail those steps later in this report.
But first, a little background information about the importance of your blood pressure to your health.
What do the Numbers Mean?
If you’ve ever had your blood pressure taken, you know that there are two num­bers given in a blood pressure reading. The upper or first number is your systolic blood pressure reading. The lower or second number is your diastolic pressure.
Example:
120 / 80 =
120 systolic arterial pressure and
80 diastolic arterial pressure
Systolic pressure is the highest pressure, in your arteries and occurs when your ventricles contract at the beginning of your cardiac cycle.
Diastolic pressure refers to the lowest arterial pressure, and occurs during the resting phase of your cardiac cycle.
Both numbers in a blood pressure test are important, but if you’re 50 or older, your systolic pressure gives the most accurate diagnosis of high blood pressure.
According to the most recent report (issued 2003) by the Joint National Commit­tee (JNC) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure[2], the following guidelines apply for determining whether you might suf­fer from hypertension:
Blood Pressure Classification
Systolic
Diastolic
Normal
<120
and <80
Pre-hypertension
120-139
or 80-89
Stage 1 Hypertension
140-159
or 90-99
Stage 2 Hypertension
=160
or =100
per JNC 7 Express, December 2003
Getting an Accurate Blood Pressure Reading
Your blood pressure readings can vary significantly from day to day -- even from morning to evening, and often within the same hour. It is when your blood pres­sure remains consistently elevated that significant health problems can occur.
It’s important to remember that there are several variables that can affect the va­lidity of your blood pressure reading.
For example:
If you’re overweight, a size ‘average’ blood pressure cuff can lead to a falsely elevated blood pressure reading. Estimates indicate that eight to ten percent of overweight and obese patients are wrongly diag­nosed as hypertensive due to ill-fitting blood pressure cuffs. Since two-thirds of Americans are overweight, this is a significant concern. You should make sure your doctor or health care professional is using the right size cuff for your size.
Arm position. If your blood pressure is taken while your arm is parallel to your body, your reading can be up to 10 percent higher than it really is. Blood pressure readings should always be taken with your arm at a right angle to your body.
White coat hypertension, which is an elevation in blood pressure caused by the stress or fear associated with visits to doctors and other medical personnel, can be a transient but serious concern. Stress reduction in this situation is key.
But guess what often happens when a patient receives just a single ele­vated reading at the doctor’s office? That patient is typically diagnosed as hyperten­sive and a prescription is written. This can set off a chain of events which results in even higher readings at future visits, higher doses prescribed of current drugs, and the introduction of additional drugs.

This is a vicious cycle that might have been avoided had certain precautions been taken. If this happens to you be very careful, as it’s important to have at least three ele­vated readings over a few weeks before you can be confident that you truly have hypertension. The exception would be very elevated blood pressures which could increase your risk for stroke -- that situation should be treated without waiting.
Hypertension: When Your Blood Pressure is too High
Some of the main causes of hypertension include lifestyle factors that you have total control over, which are primarily related to your insulin levels (for example, eating a high-grain and high-sugar diet, and not exercising).
If you have high blood pressure, you probably have too much insulin and are in­sulin resistant. There is often a direct relationship between the level of insulin and blood pressure readings. As your insulin level elevates, so does your blood pres­sure.
Keeping your insulin level in the healthy range is of paramount importance to ideal blood pressure readings.
The good news is that if you have hypertension, making the appropriate lifestyle changes, which I will review later in this report, will very likely normalize your blood pressure.
Blood Pressure and Big Pharma
It’s important to understand that national guidelines for what constitutes high blood pressure or hypertension (HTN) are heavily influenced by drug companies.
There are about 100 different drugs that treat high blood pressure, and the JNC’s report is remarkable for its heavy emphasis on drugs, and many times multiple drugs in combination, to treat the condition.
Alternative recommendations for prevention and treatment are barely mentioned. Nowhere in the report will you find information about insulin resistance as the primary cause of high blood pressure in most people.
And here’s a stunner.
According to a survey reported by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in July 2003 (the same year the JNC 7 re­port was issued), despite the number of drugs available and number of prescrip­tions writ­ten, no real progress has been made in controlling high blood pressure among the U.S. adult population.[3]
The survey found that:
One in three U.S. adults has high blood pressure
Nearly a third of people with HTN don’t know they have the condition
Over 40 percent were not being treated
Nearly three out of four people did not have their HTN under control
Another study reported by the Archives of Internal Medicine in 2000 revealed that 30 percent of patients with mild to moderate hypertension responded well to a placebo -- proof that they were able to control their blood pressure without medi­cation.
Yet another study reported by the British Medical Association in June 2003, re­vealed that 97 percent of people taking drugs for high blood pressure had suf­fered significant side effects at some point during treatment.
That means you only have three chances out of 100 that you will be side-effect-free if you choose to take drugs to control your high blood pressure.
Prescription Drugs are Not Your Best Choice
It should come as no surprise to learn that the majority of conventional physi­cians apply a cookbook model to treating hypertension, rather than treating the individual patient and addressing the underlying causes, which have far more to do with lifestyle choices than unavoidable aging.
High blood pressure is in fact an easily treated condition, but one that can cause serious damage to your health if it’s ignored.
Drugs, however, are rarely the answer.
There are in the neighborhood of 100 pharmaceutical drugs deemed ‘safe and effective’ for the treatment of high blood pressure.
And since most blood pressure patients take more than one medication to treat their condition, there is a potentially endless supply of drugs, and drug combinations, available with the flick of a pen across a prescription pad – no life­style changes required.
This despite the fact that lifestyle changes have been shown to normalize blood pressure levels in over 85 percent of sufferers!
Since stress is widely known to have a significant effect on blood pressure, how is it the Joint National Committee fails to so much as suggest stress manage­ment in its life­style modification information?
A study reported by the Archives of Internal Medicine indicates that even ‘white coat hypertension,’ a transient condition brought on by stress in the presence of medical personnel, is more serious than once thought. In fact, white coat hyper­tensives suffer heart damage similar to, though not as dramatic as that seen in people with chronic high blood pressure.[4]
The connection between stress and high blood pressure is proven. Unresolved stress issues are at least as significant to your overall health as poor diet and lack of exercise.
New Guidelines Mean New Patients and More Prescriptions
Also worthy of mention is that this seventh JNC report ushered in new guidelines for blood pressure readings.
Up until its publication, a 120/80 reading was con­sidered normal. Now, a reading between 120-139 systolic and 80-89 diastolic is considered pre-hypertensive. Suddenly, in December 2003, 45 million healthy Americans became new poten­tial consumers of anti-hypertensive drugs. This, despite the fact that there is ab­solutely no evidence these people are at risk for chronic high blood pressure.
We would all be wise to question what’s behind a gold standard medical report on the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure that covers lifestyle is­sues in a single brief paragraph. Not a word of discussion about the link between insulin and hypertension. Not a word about the importance of managing stress.
Normalize Your Blood Pressure Naturally, For Life
The remainder of this special report will show you how to normalize your blood pressure for the rest of your life, without dangerous drugs.
The following information will not only help you bring your blood pressure under control, it will optimize your overall health and the quality of your life in countless other ex­citing ways. You’ll read about the importance of ...
Eliminating two types of foods that are poison for most people, but espe­cially if you have high blood pressure
Balancing the omega fats in your diet
Normalizing your weight
Managing your emotional life
'Drugging' yourself with exercise
Appropriate sunshine exposure
Experimenting with supplements and other alternative tips for improving your blood pressure
Eliminate Grains and Sugars from Your Diet
If you have high blood pressure, the first thing you should do is remove all grains and sweets from your diet until both your weight and your blood pressure have normalized.[5]
When you eliminate grains and sweets from your diet, you are on your way to achieving a healthy level of insulin in your bloodstream.
The role insulin plays in high blood pressure cannot be overstated.
If you are like most people with hypertension, you have insulin receptors that don’t work efficiently. You have a condition known as insulin resistance (IR). To compensate, your body generates more insulin.
Eating sug­ars and grains -- in­cluding any type of bread, pasta, corn, potatoes, or rice -- will cause your insulin levels to remain elevated.
Elevated insulin levels are very toxic and can lead to devastating consequences for your health.
Insulin stores magnesium, but if your insulin receptors are blunted and your cells grow resistant to insulin, you can’t store magnesium and it passes out of your body through urination. Magnesium stored in your cells relaxes muscles. If your magnesium level is too low, your blood vessels will constrict rather than relax, which will raise your blood pressure and decrease your energy level.[6]
Insulin also affects your blood pressure by causing your body to retain sodium. Sodium retention causes fluid retention. Fluid retention in turn causes high blood pressure, and can ultimately lead to congestive heart failure.
When you consume a high-carbohydrate meal, you raise both your blood sugar and your insulin level. A high level of insulin acts as a very strong stimulant to your sympathetic nervous system. The reaction of your sympathetic nervous system causes spasms -- constrictions -- of your arteries. And if you already suf­fer from hypertension, this further constriction of your blood vessels can increase your risk of a heart attack.
Other Dietary Considerations
Eat right for your nutritional type
Eating according to your nutritional type tends to normalize elevated blood pressures in the vast majority of people.
When you address your nutritional type -- your unique biochemical needs, which are based on your specific genetics -- your health problems are addressed at the foundational level, and you are far more likely to achieve a permanent solution for regaining your health.
If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, or are overweight, it is highly likely that you are eating too many grains -- yes, even unrefined whole grains -- as this is the most common culprit causing your insulin level to become abnormal. The Nutritional Typing diet, however, will help you to not only reduce your intake of sugar and grains (which is beneficial for most everyone), but even more importantly, will help you determine your optimal ratios of carbohydrates to healthy fats and proteins.
Normalize your omega 6:3 ratio
Both omega-3 and omega-6 fats are essential for your health. Most Americans, however, are getting too much omega-6 in their diet and far too little omega-3. Consuming omega-3 fats is one of the best ways to re-sensitize your insulin receptors if you suffer from insulin resistance.
Omega-6 fats are found in corn, soy, canola, safflower and sunflower oil. If you’re consuming a lot of these oils, you’ll want to avoid or limit them.
Omega-3 fats are typically found in flaxseed oil, walnut oil and fish, with fish being by far the best source. Unfortunately, most fresh fish today contains dangerously high levels of mercury. Your best bet is to find a safe source of fish, or if this proves too difficult, you can supplement with Krill Oil, which has been found to be 48 times more potent than fish oil.
Eliminate caffeine
The connection between caffeine consumption and high blood pressure is not well understood, but there is ample evidence to indicate that if you have hypertension, coffee and other caffeinated drinks and foods can ex­acerbate your condition.
Caffeine is a drug, and while it’s entirely legal and widely consumed, it can have a powerful affect on your individual physiology.
If you want to eliminate caffeine from your diet, try to do it gradually over a period of days or even weeks in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms like headaches.
Normalize Your Weight
If you are overweight, have diabetes, already have high blood pressure or are at risk for devel­oping hypertension, it’s crucial to your health and longevity that you normalize your weight.
Studies show that even a modest weight loss, when maintained, can reduce blood pressure long-term.[7] The key is to keep the weight off, however, because your blood pressure will quite likely go back up right along with any weight you regain.
The best way to optimize your weight and regain or improve your health is to first understand the profound influence the foods you eat have on your physiology.
Two very important things to keep in mind:
Food is fuel
You are unique in terms of the type of fuel your body needs for optimal health
The simple truth is that one-size-fits-all diets -- whether intended for weight loss, or to address a particular health concern -- will not work for everyone. That’s why some people are helped by, for example, a high protein-low carbohydrate regi­men while others become ill from it.
There is no perfect diet for everyone.
The challenge is to learn what the best foods are for you. You can do that by discovering your Nutritional Type™.[8]
Once you learn your Nutritional Type™ and begin eating in accordance with your body’s needs, you’ll be making food and other nutritional choices that will ad­dress your weight issues and other health concerns.
Eating for your Nutritional Type™ is not like dieting.
With a cookie cutter diet, you’re apt to feel deprived much of the time -- maybe even ill -- because the diet might be all wrong for your individual nutritional requirements. Consuming the right fuel for your body’s needs based on your Nutritional Type™, however, can have an immediate, positive impact on the way you feel, how you look, and your health overall.
It is not a ‘quick fix,’ mind you -- no healthy lifestyle change is -- but you will notice improvement as soon as you begin to eat the appropriate foods for your personal biochemistry and metabolism.
Learn to Manage Your Emotional Stress
As I stated before, the link between stress and hypertension is well documented.[9]
Doctors and health care professionals committed to treating the whole person rather than a list of physical symptoms are well aware of the crucial con­nection between diseases of the body and unresolved emotional conflict.
Studies back this up, and in fact, it has been shown that people with heart dis­ease can lower their risk of subsequent cardiac events by over 70 percent simply by learning to manage their stress.
Suppressed negative emotions such as fear, anger and sadness can severely limit your ability to cope with the unavoidable every day stresses of life.
It’s not the stressful events themselves that are harmful, but your lack of ability to cope.
The good news is, the technology exists to quickly and effectively transform your suppressed, negative emotions, and relieve stress.
Energy psychology tools like the Meridian Tapping Technique (MTT) are avail­able to assist you in optimizing your emotional health. You can find more infor­mation about MTT on my website.
Use Exercise as a Drug
It’s no secret that regular physical activity is a far better drug than anything a pharmaceutical company can manufacture, as are the ‘side effects’ of exercise. Regardless of the primary reason you start an exercise program, your efforts will be rewarded in countless other ways.
A rigorous comprehensive exercise program seems to be very important in producing long-term benefits in people with high blood pressure. Depending on your physical condi­tion when you embark on an exercise program, you may need to consult with a health care professional who can help you can increase to the intensity required to make a difference in lowering your insulin levels.
As a general rule, weight bearing exercises like walking, jogging and running are best.
Studies indicate that aerobic activities like these are most beneficial for lowering blood pressure.[10]
Cycling and swimming take longer to produce the same results, but if you enjoy them, by all means include them in your routine.
Swimming in the ocean is highly preferable to swimming in a chlorinated pool, as pool chemicals present their own set of health problems.
Nearly every program should incorporate a fair measure of anaerobic sprint or burst-type exercises, as these have been shown to be even more effective than aerobic exercises at reducing the risk of dying from a heart attack.
Weight training is another wonderful strategy, especially if you can extend your workout time to 90 minutes a few days a week to include both aerobic and anaerobic ex­ercises in those longer sessions.
If you are insulin resistant, you’ll definitely want to include weight training in your exercise program. When you work individual muscle groups, you increase blood flow to those muscles. Good blood flow will increase your insulin sensitivity.
If you are overweight with hypertension, you should engage in relatively intense exercise six to nine hours a week in order to decrease the sensitivity of your in­sulin receptors.[11] Intense means exerting yourself sufficiently that you can’t com­fortably talk to someone during your workout.
Get a Daily Dose of Sunshine
Believe it or not, the farther you live from the equator, the higher your risk of de­veloping high blood pressure. And did you know that blood pressure is typi­cally higher in winter months than during the summer?[12]
Sunlight actually affects blood pressure in several ways:
Sun exposure causes your body to produce vitamin D. Lack of sunlight re­duces your vitamin D stores and increases parathyroid hormone produc­tion, which increases blood pressure.
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to insulin resistance (IR) and Syndrome X (also known as Metabolic Syndrome), a group of health problems that can include IR, elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, obesity, and high blood pressure.[13]
Vitamin D is also a negative inhibitor of your body’s renin-angiotensin sys­tem (RAS), which regulates blood pressure. If you’re vitamin D deficient, it can cause inappropriate activation of your RAS, which may lead to hy­pertension.[14]
Additionally, exposure to UV rays is thought to cause the release of endor­phins, chemicals in your brain that produce feelings of euphoria and relief from pain.[15] Endorphins naturally relieve stress, and stress management is an important factor in resolving hypertension.
Exposure to sunlight is a basic requirement for your health, and not only to nor­malize your blood pressure. Vitamin D helps systems and organs throughout your body function properly.
Vitamin D receptors can be found in almost every type of cell in your body.
You can achieve nearly all of the benefits of sun exposure by using a safe tanning bed. This will be an important alternative to sun exposure in the winter for those who are unable to “snowbird” away to a sub tropical environment.
You can view my free one hour lecture for more details on vitamin D.
A Word About Vitamin D Supplements ...
Please do NOT let your doctor give you a “prescription” vitamin D. That is vitamin D2, which is synthetic, and not nearly as beneficial as the real vitamin D, which is D3 (cholecalciferol).
If you decide to supplement with oral vitamin D3, you must carefully monitor your vitamin D blood levels to avoid overdosing. (This is why it is highly preferable to get your vitamin D through sun exposure since there is virtually no chance of overdosing.)
When getting your levels checked, it’s important to make sure you’re in the opti­mal range. A ‘normal’ level is considered 20-56 ng/ml or 50-140 nmol/l. However, this is not the time to be ‘average.’ Instead, aim to maintain an optimal 25-hy­droxyvitamin D value of 50-65 ng/ml. Your vitamin D level should not be below 40 ng/ml.
To learn much more about vitamin D test values and the best labs to get your tests done, please visit the following page.
About Supplements and Other Alternatives
Although I have listed some supplements below to be complete, please understand that they are in NO way shape or form to ever be considered as an alternative to the primary recommendations above which treat the real cause of the problem.
Only using the supplements below without incorporating the lifestyle recommendations discussed above is an allopathic approach not very different from using drugs.
Calcium and magnesium. Daily calcium and magnesium supplementa­tion can be useful in lowering blood pressure, especially if yours is on the high end of high. However, if you avoid sugars and grains and eat for your Nutritional Type™ (see above), it’s unlikely additional calcium or magnesium sup­plements will be necessary.
Vitamins C and E. Studies indicate that these vitamins can be helpful in lowering blood pressure.[17] If you’re eating for your Nutritional Type™, you should be getting the right amount of both these nutrients through your diet alone. If you decide you need a supplement, make sure to take a natural (not synthetic) form of vitamin E. You can tell what you’re buying by care­fully reading the label. Natural vitamin E is always listed as the ‘d-‘ form (d-alpha-tocopherol, d-beta-tocopherol, etc.) Synthetic vitamin E is listed as ‘dl-‘ forms.
Olive leaf extract. A recent study showed that supplementing with 1,000 mg of olive leaf extract daily over eight weeks caused a significant dip in both blood pressure and LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol in people with borderline hypertension.[18] If you want to incorporate olive leaves as a natural adjunct to a nutrition­ally sound diet, you should look for fresh leaf liquid extracts for maximum synergistic potency. You can also prepare your own olive leaf tea by placing a large teaspoon of dried olive leaves in a tea ball or herb sack. Place it in about two quarts of boiling water and let it steep for three to 10 minutes. The tea should be a medium amber color when done.
Electrical acupuncture. Acupuncture combined with electrical stimulation has shown to temporarily lower elevations in blood pressure in animals by as much as 50 percent.[19] It’s currently undergoing testing in humans and could be a promising alternative treatment for controlling blood pressure.
For parents. If your children lose their cool while playing video games, this could signal they are at risk for developing hypertension in later years.[20] The video games available these days can be very violent in na­ture, which is cause for further concern. Encourage a balance in your children’s activities. Ideally, they should be involved in exercise and other physically active pursuits during the major­ity of their leisure time. The sedentary lifestyle of so many children today is contributing to obesity and other chronic conditions and diseases, includ­ing high blood pressure.
For moms of newborns. Studies have shown that babies who are breast­fed for more than 12 months have a dramatically reduced risk of de­velop­ing hypertension.[21] Researchers believe long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (the same found in fatty fish) in breast milk provide a protective ef­fect for newborns.
Quick tricks. Increasing nitric oxide in your blood can open con­stricted blood vessels and lower your blood pressure. Methods for in­creasing the compound include taking a warm bath, breathing in and out through one nostril (close off the other nostril and your mouth), and eating bitter melon, rich in amino acids and vitamin C.
Like obesity, high blood pressure is reaching epidemic proportions among American adults. If big drug companies had their way, there would be at least as many drugs available to treat obesity as there are for hypertension. But as study after study shows, drugging with pharmaceuticals is a short-term, unreliable, and often quite dangerous approach to treating symptoms rather than the underlying causes of disease.
A natural approach to preventing disease and healing yourself when illness strikes is always the better choice. In the case of high blood pressure, lifestyle changes -- with particular emphasis on normalizing your insulin levels -- can put you on the road to a drug-free, all natural return to optimal health.

Annual costs for treating those patients are expected to soar, nearly tripling from the current $113 billion to some $336 billion.
The figures are, if anything, on the conservative side, since they are based on the notion that obesity levels will plateau, and even decline, by 2033. If actual prevalence outpaces these estimates, the cases of diabetes, and resulting costs, could be even higher.
Past estimates often dramatically underestimated just how quickly the problem would grow. Figures from 1991 projected that some 11.6 million Americans would have diabetes by 2030. In fact, that's fewer than half of the total number of Americans with diabetes right now."

He found that scientists who had studied the brains of MS patients had noticed higher levels of iron in their brain, not accounted for by age. The iron deposits had a unique pattern, often forming in the core of the brain, clustered around the veins that normally drain blood from the head.
Dr. Zamboni wondered if the iron came from blood improperly collecting in the brain. Using Doppler ultrasound, he began examining the necks of MS patients and made an extraordinary finding. Almost 100 percent of the patients had a narrowing, twisting or outright blockage of the veins that are supposed to flush blood from the brain. He then checked these veins in healthy people, and found none of these malformations. Nor did he find these blockages in those with other neurological conditions.
Zamboni dubbed the vein disorder he discovered CCSVI, or Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency. He enlisted the help of vascular surgeon Dr. R. Galeotti. The team began a study in which they treated 65 MS patients to see if endovascular surgery would restore flow in these vessels and lessen MS symptoms.
Preliminary results show patients had a decrease in the number of new MS attacks, a big reduction in the number of brain lesions that define MS, and improved quality of life.
Because the surgery freed the blood flow, the team dubbed the procedure ""The Liberation Treatment.""
A separate analysis has also shown that marijuana may help multiple sclerosis patients find relief from the muscle spasms that are the hallmark of the debilitating autoimmune disease. After reviewing six studies where marijuana was used by MS patients, researchers found five of the trials showed that marijuana reduced spasms and improved mobility."

There is an ever-growing body of scientific data that shows substantial health benefits of CoQ10 supplementation for people suffering from angina, heart attack and hypertension.

The flu season is upon us.
Staying well while those around you sniffle and sneeze requires that you extract as much nutrition from your diet as you can, loading up on the foods that pack the biggest nutritional punch.
Avoiding processed foods, grains, and sugar will go a long way toward strengthening your immune system. However, you can do even more by selecting foods that are loaded with specific immune-boosting nutrients.
Eating a diet rich in the following foods will be far better for your health than loading up on handfuls of supplements, or worse yet, falling victim to vaccines that expose you to health risks far worse than influenza.
Below, I have outlined what I consider to be the absolute best foods you can eat to help protect yourself this season, although the list is certainly not exhaustive.
Unpasteurized Grass-Fed Organic Milk

Raw organic milk from grass-fed cows contains beneficial bacteria that prime your immune system and can reduce allergies. It is an outstanding source of vitamins, especially vitamin A, zinc, and enzymes. Raw organic milk is not associated with any of the health problems of pasteurized milk such as rheumatoid arthritis, skin rashes, diarrhea and cramps.
Raw milkalso contains beneficial fats that will help your immune system.
Although raw milk availability is limited in the US depending on where you live, you can locate the source closest to you at RealMilk.com.
Whey Protein
Even if you don't have access to raw milk, you can use a high-quality whey protein that comes from grass-fed cows to receive much of the same health benefits
The protein in milk is whey protein. Whey is the liquid that separates from the curd during the production of cheese. When the liquid dries into powdered whey, the nutrients become concentrated, and it can be packaged and used in that form.
Whey protein can help you fight off colds and flu because it contains beta-glucans and immunoglobulins, which protect your immune system and support your body's natural detoxification processes.
Fermented Foods

If you are serious about boosting your immunity, then adding traditionally fermented foods is essential.
One of the most healthful fermented foods is kefir. Kefir is an ancient cultured, enzyme-rich food full of friendly microorganisms that balance your ""inner ecosystem"" and strengthen immunity.
Besides kefir, other good fermented foods include natto, kimchee, miso, tempeh, pickles, sauerkraut, yogurt (watch out for sugar), and olives.
Friendly bacteria have a powerful, beneficial effect on your gut's immune system, your first line of defense against pathogens, and aid in the production of antibodies
Raw Organic Eggs from Free-Range Chickens

Before you wrinkle up your nose, raw eggs are an inexpensive and amazing source of high-quality nutrients that many people are deficient in, especially high-quality protein and fat. I am a proponent of raw eggs because they have been so helpful to my own health.
As long as you have a good source for fresh, organic raw eggs, you need not worry about salmonella. To find free-range pasture farms, try your local health food store, or go to http://www.eatwild.com or http://www.localharvest.org.
Grass-Fed Beef or Organ Meats

This recommendation is only valid if you are a protein or mixed nutritional type as carb types really should not be eating beef. Grass-fed beef comes from cows that eat what they were meant to eat—grasses, not corn or grains. This results in far greater health benefits for you and for the environment.1
Grass-fed beef is very high in vitamins A and E, omega-3 fatty acids, beta-carotene, zinc, and CLA. CLA (conjugated linoleic acid, a fatty acid) is three to five times higher in grass-fed animals than grain-fed animals and is an immune system enhancer.
Don't confuse ""organic"" with grass-fed, since many organically raised cows are still fed organic corn, which you don't want. However, most grass-fed cows are raised organically. And if you can find organic AND grass-fed, that's ideal.
Coconuts and Coconut Oil

Besides being excellent for your thyroid and your metabolism, coconut oil is rich in lauric acid, which converts in your body to monolaurin. Monolaurin is the actual compound found in breast milk that strengthens a baby's immunity
A great deal of research has been done establishing the ability of lauric acid to enhance immunity. This medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) actually disrupts the lipid membranes of offending organisms
When selecting coconuts and coconut oil, make sure you choose organic ones that are unrefined, unbleached, made without heat processing or chemicals, and are non-GMO.
Locally Grown Organic Vegetables Appropriate for Your Nutritional Type

When it comes to fighting off pathogens, you simply can't do any better than eating a variety of fresh, organic and preferably raw vegetables for the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and enzymes they contain. However , the amount and type of vegetables you should eat daily will depend on your nutritional type.
Make sure the veggies you choose are fresh. The nutrient value drops to practically zero once a fruit or vegetable is canned. For example, take a look at the ORAC value of peaches
ORAC Values
ORAC stands for Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity, and an ORAC unit or ORAC ""score"" is a standardized method of measuring the antioxidant capacity of different foods and supplements. The higher the ORAC score, the more effective a food is at neutralizing free radicals. The less free radicals you have, the healthier you will be.
Back to peaches
A raw, fresh peach has an ORAC score of 1,814. A can of peaches in heavy syrup has an ORAC score of 436, meaning that more than 75 percent of the antioxidants are lost in the canning process.
You can check the ORAC score for many different things at www.oracvalues.com. The higher the score, the better. Please be aware, though, that the total antioxidant capacity of a food alone does not determine its health benefit, which depends on how it is absorbed and utilized by your body. ORAC score is a useful guide, but it is only part of the picture.
Blueberries and Raspberries

Blueberries and raspberries rate very high in antioxidant capacity (ORAC of 6,520) compared to other fruits and vegetables. Wild blueberries in particular are potent immune boosters. They contain powerful phytochemicals, such as anthocyanin, which is the pigment that gives blueberries their color. And they are lower in sugar than many other fruits.
Mushrooms

Mushrooms strengthen your immune system because they are rich in protein, fiber, vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, and other minerals.
Mushrooms make up a large part of the fabric of the earth. According to Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading authorities on the health benefits of mushrooms, one cubic inch of soil can contain eight miles of mycelium.2
Mushrooms also contain powerful compounds called beta-glucans, which have been long known for their immune enhancing properties. The beta-glucans in medicinal mushrooms (especially Reishi, Shiitake, and Maitake) are notable for their ability to activate/modulate your immune system.
Beta-glucan 3 enhances immunity through a variety of mechanisms, many of which are similar to those of echinacea or astragalus root. For example, it binds to macrophages and other scavenger white blood cells, activating their anti-infection activities.4 Numerous studies support this.
Chlorella

As foods go, chlorella is nearly perfect.
Chlorella is a single-cell freshwater algae that acts as an efficient detoxification agent by binding to toxins, such as mercury, and carries them out of your system. It is the chlorophyll in chlorella that makes it so powerful. Chlorophyll helps you process more oxygen, cleanses your blood and promotes the growth and repair of your tissues.
For a full review of all the benefits of this superfood, go to my chlorella page.
Propolis

Propolis is a bee resin and one of the most broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds in the world, if not the broadest spectrum, according to master herbalist Donnie Yance. Propolis is also the richest source of caffeic acid and apigenin, two very important phenolic compounds that aid in immune response.
Teas

The three best types of tea for fending off microinvaders are Matcha green tea, tulsi tea and chaga tea.
Green Tea and Matcha
Matcha is the most nutrient-rich green tea and comes in the form of a stone-ground powder, completely unfermented. The best Matcha comes from Japan and has up to seventeen times the antioxidants of wild blueberries, and seven times more than dark chocolate.
Green teas are rich in polyphenols, in the form of natural chemicals called catechins. The most powerful catechin in tea is epigallocatechin (EGCG), which was found in one study to be 25 to 100 times more potent than antioxidant vitamins C and E. And Matcha is more than 100 times as potent in EGCG as regular brewed green tea.
Tulsi
Tulsi tea, coming from the holy basil herb, has been used for thousands of years in the Ayurvedic medicine of India. Not only is this tea loaded with antioxidants, but it has multiple positive health benefits, including supporting your immune health, memory, heart health and vision.
Chaga Tea
Chaga tea, brewed from chaga mushrooms, is widely used in Russia, Poland and other countries, mainly due to its ability to help with numerous body conditions. Chaga tea is rich in numerous antioxidants and Beta-d-Glucans, which directly influence the body’s immune response and aid in fighting off pathogens and other harmful agents.
Herbs and Spices

Herbs and spices are at the top of the list of high ORAC value foods on planet Earth.5 There are simply too many good ones to summarize here! So I will simply highlight a few that deserve special mention.
Garlic
Garlic, although not at the top of the ORAC chart (5,346), is incredibly beneficial to your immune system because it offers a triple-whammy: it's antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal. You should be eating garlic every day. One of the best things about garlic is that bacteria, viruses, and yeast build up no resistance to it, unlike with synthetic antibiotics.
For optimal benefits, garlic should be fresh since the active ingredient is destroyed within one hour of smashing the garlic cloves. In other words, garlic capsules are basically useless.
Garlic contains allicin, a chemical that is anticarcinogenic. It also has been shown to lower LDL, lower total cholesterol, lower blood pressure, reduce your risk of blood clots and stroke, lower homocysteine, and even prevent insect bites --including mosquitoes and ticks.
Herbs and Spice and Everything Nice
Immunity from common infections involves not only preventing pathogens from taking hold, but also moderating your immune response to invading pathogens.
Complications arise when you experience an over-response to the infection, which is why H1N1 is taking its toll on healthy young adults. Their bodies are over responding -- something called a ""cytokine storm."" It's basically a severe inflammatory response.6
One wonderful thing about plants (and herbs especially) is that they don't all stimulate your immune system—some modulate it, or act as a buffer.
Here are some of the best herbs and spices for building a strong immune system that functions correctly:
Honeysuckle and chrysanthemum: good antivirals
Artemisia: antimalarial
Andrographis, aka ""King of Bitters"": antiviral, and helps modulate inflammatory response7
Licorice: buffers the inflammatory response by increasing steroid output by the adrenal glands; a good buffer if your immune system is over responding to the flu.
Turmeric : ORAC score of 159,277; general immune system booster due to its high antioxidant capacity, and an anticancer agent as well; turmeric is five to eight times stronger than vitamins C and E, and even strong enough to scavenge the hydroxyl radical, which is considered by some to be the most reactive of all oxidants
Black Pepper: Increases the bioavailability of just about all other foods -- herbs and other things
Oregano : ORAC 13,970; active agent is rosmarinic acid, a strong antioxidant; one tablespoon of oregano has the antioxidant capacity of one medium apple
Cinnamon : ORAC 267,536; powerful antimicrobial agent—found to kill E. coli and many other bacteria; also has anti-inflammatory compounds
Cloves: THE BIG ORAC GRAND PRIZE WINNER AT 314,446, highest of all foods tested! Contains eugenol; its mild anesthetic benefits are useful for toothaches and sore throats; good anti-inflammatory8
Finally, I recently had a fascinating interview with herbalist Donnie Yance, who shared his basic remedy for flu, should you come down with one.
Make this special tea from a combination of herbs that synergistically cause your body to sweat -- which is very desirable if you want to eradicate a virus from your system. And then drink it hot and often:
Elderflower (this has been used for hundreds of years for flu)
Boneset (eupatorium)
Yarrow
Linden
Peppermint
Ginger
By incorporating some of these fantastic foods, you'll not only evade the circulating viruses but improve your overall health and longevity at the same time."

When did you begin to suspect that the cholesterol theory of atherosclerosis might be wrong? What led you to this conclusion? Before then, had you believed in the cholesterol theory? Was this part of your training?
I have never thought that it was true. I heard about it for the first time in 1962 shortly after getting my MD. My biochemical knowledge was still intact at that time and I knew that cholesterol was one of the most important molecules in your body, indispensable for the building of your cells and for producing stress and sex hormones as well as vitamin D.
The idea that cholesterol in the blood should kill us if its concentration is a little higher than normal, as they wrote in the Framingham paper, seemed to me just as silly as to claim that yellow fingers cause lung cancer.
Would you tell my readers about your training, publications, university appointments, other professional activities?
The first seven years as a doctor I worked in different medical departments in Denmark and Sweden. In 1968 I started my academic career at the Department of Nephrology, University Hospital in Lund, where I got my PhD. After a few years I organized a research team to investigate the association between hydrocarbon exposure and glomerulonephritis
Unfortunately I caught one of my coworkers in producing a fraudulent paper. It was unfortunate, because it is risky to be a whistleblower in the academic world. Instead of excluding the fraudulent researcher it was my research that was questioned. The resistance against my research from my superiors became intolerable, and I therefore decided to go into private practice.
Nevertheless I succeeded in publishing the main part of my research in major medical journals after having left the department. I have summarized my findings and conclusions on the web as well.
In the late eighties the cholesterol campaign was started in Sweden. I was very surprised because I couldn’t recall anything in the scientific literature in support of it. I started reading it systematically, and I soon realized that I was right.
Since then I have published about eighty papers and letter, and also books, translated into five languages, where I  present my arguments and criticism.
How has your work been received by your colleagues; by healthcare professionals and consumers around the world?
In the beginning nobody took notice. To ignore criticism is the most effective way to maintain a false idea. My first book was published in Sweden in 1991 with a Finnish edition shortly afterwards. The Swedish one made no impact whatsoever, and the Finnish one was put on fire in a television show.
Ridicule and slander have been used as well, as a means to muffle me
After I had aired my warnings against statin treatment in Dutch television, for instance, Dutch researchers described me in a following show as a crackpot who had been kicked from the universities of Copenhagen and Lund. The directors of the show offered my critics a possibility to discuss the issue with me on television, but all of them declined. On his blog, Michael Eades has described how one of them later on belittled me in a scientific paper.
But I have also realized that I am not alone.
Seven years ago I started THINCS, The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics (www.thincs.org ), which by now includes about eighty doctors, professors and other researchers from all over the world, who share my skepticism, and I have received two international awards for my contributions.
Also encouraging is the hundreds of emails that I receive every year from patients, who have regained their health after having stopped their cholesterol-lowering treatment.
Your work seems to validate what many integrative health care professionals have been saying for decades. How does the alternative community respond to you?
There is a much more open attitude from these people.
If the cholesterol hypothesis is an error, does this mean that all of its therapies – low cholesterol diet, cholesterol lowering natural therapies and medications -- are wrong?
Absolutely. This kind of treatment is meaningless, costly, and has transformed millions of healthy people into patients.
Specifically, what are your views on statins?
Their benefit is trivial, and has been seen only in male patients who already have heart disease.
Worse is that their many adverse effects are ignored or cleverly belittled by the trial directors. Independent researchers have found many more and in much higher numbers. If they are true it means that today millions of previously healthy people probably consider their weak and painful muscles, their bad memory, their sexual failure, and their cancer to be a consequence of increasing age, and so do their doctors.
The risk of cancer is most alarming. Both animal experiments, epidemiological studies and several of the statin trials have shown that low cholesterol predisposes to cancer.
The widespread use of statin treatment probably explains why the decrease of the smoking habit that has been going on in many countries hasn’t been followed by a decrease of cancer mortality. We should have seen a decrease because smoking predispose not only to bronchial cancer, but to all kinds of cancer.
Drug companies market vigorously the highest, strongest doses of statins. Lipitor is pushed at the highest dosage, 80 mg. This dosage is the most powerful for lowering cholesterol and LDL, but it also causes more adverse effects and costs more than lower doses. What are your thoughts about this?
The outcome from these trials is a further demonstration that the small benefit from statin treatment has nothing to do with cholesterol.
For instance, although cholesterol plummeted and remained at about 50 percent below the initial value during the whole SEAS trial, it did not change mortality, but it increased the number of cancer with statistical significance.
Even worse was the result of the ENHANCE trial, where atherosclerosis in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia progressed the most among those whose cholesterol was lowered the most.
If statins can be helpful in reducing the incidence of heart attacks, who should take them?
In my view, nobody.
When I was practicing, I used to describe the benefit in this way: Considering your age and your previous heart attack, your chance to be alive in five years is about 90 percent. You can increase that chance to 92 percent if you take a statin pill every day, but then you may also expose yourself to its many adverse effects.
From the data I have seen, statins have not produced a reduction in overall cardiac deaths. Do you have any idea of why this is?
You are right. Heart mortality in Sweden is going downwards, but the reduction started already in the 1960’s. The cause is most probably that treatment of acute myocardial infarction has improved, because the mortality curve has not changed after the introduction of the statins.
The reason may be that their small benefit is counteracted by an increasing frequency of heart failure.
As you know, the statins block not only the synthesis of cholesterol, but also of other vital molecules, for instance coenzyme Q10, and muscle cells, including those of the heart, can’t function properly without Q10.
Do you think mainstream medicine will ever relinquish its view that elevated cholesterol causes heart disease, and that statins are the magic bullet?
I hope so. The failures of the most recent statin trials have been commented on by several journalists in the major U.S. newspapers. In Sweden a revolution is going on. Here, a general practitioner treated her own obesity successfully by eating a low-carbohydrate diet with a high content of animal fat. When she advised her obese and diabetic patients to do the same, she was reported to the National Board of Health and Welfare for malpractice.
After a two-year-long investigation she was acquitted, as her treatment was considered to be in accord with scientific evidence.
At the same time, the Board dismissed two experts, who had been appointed for updating the dietary recommendations for diabetics, because it came up that they were sponsored by the food industry. Instead the Board has asked independent researchers to review the scientific literature.
The subject has gained general attention due to a number of radio and television shows, where critical experts including myself have discussed the issue with representatives of the official view.
Most important, thousands of patients have experienced themselves that by doing the opposite as recommended by the current guidelines they have regained their health!
The effect has been that the sales of butter, cream, and full-fat milk are increasing in Sweden after many years of decline, and a recent poll showed that a majority of Swedish people today think that the best way of losing weight is by a low-carbohydrate, fat-rich diet.
Further progress was achieved this spring. Several times, colleagues of mine and also I, have asked the Swedish Food Administration for the scientific basis of their warnings against saturated fat. We have been met with the argument that there are thousands of such studies, or by referrals to the WHO guidelines or the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations.
As the main argument in the latter two -- that saturated fat raises cholesterol -- we were not satisfied with their answer, and finally the Food Administration published a list with 72 studies that they claimed were in support of their view on saturated fat, and twelve that were not.
We scrutinized the lists and found that only two of the 72 studies supported their standpoint; eleven studies did not concern saturated fat at all, and the unsupportive list was incomplete, to put it mildly.
We published a short report with our comments to these lists in the Swedish medical journal Dagens Medicin. A response from the Food Administration appeared seven weeks later in which they pointed out that their recommendations were directed to healthy people, not to patients. They maintained that they were based on solid scientific evidence, without mentioning anything about saturated fat, and without answering our critical comments.
But this is not all. Earlier this year Sachdeva et al reported that the mean cholesterol in 137,000 patients with acute myocardial infarction was lower than normal.
As usual, the authors didn’t understand their own findings, but concluded that cholesterol should be lowered even more. A few months later Al-Mallah et al. came up with the same result and conclusion, although they also reported that three years later, mortality was twice as high among those who had been admitted with the lowest cholesterol.
These results created a fierce debate in one of the major Swedish newspapers. It was opened by ninety-one-year old Lars Werkö, the ‘Grand Old Man’ in Swedish medical science, retired professor in internal medicine and former head of The Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care, together with Tore Scherstén, retired professor in surgery and former secretary of the Swedish Medical Research Council.
“Now it is time to sack the cholesterol hypothesis and to investigate the reason of this scientific breakdown” they wrote.
They also criticized American researchers in AHA and NHLBI and their followers for sloppy and fraudulent science.
They were of course attacked by two professors and representatives of the current view, but none of them came up with any substantial evidence, only with personalities.
Are there other risk factors that should be followed? Such as: C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, homocysteine, lipoprotein A... Any other factors?
Such analyses may be helpful for doctors to put the right diagnosis in patients with a disease of unknown origin.
But to check healthy people’s blood to find deviations from normal is the freeway to unnecessary medication.
Are there other alternative therapies besides statins that people might consider?
There is no reason for healthy people to take drugs, or anything else to prevent heart disease, as long as we do not know the very cause.
Don’t forget that people who die from a myocardial infarction have on average lived just as long as other people. In my talks I used to ask people, who put the same question to me, if they know a better way of dying?
What diet do you recommend people follow?
I do not give medical advice to people I haven’t seen and examined myself, and as I am retired, it means that I give no advice at all except to my family and nearest friends. I inform people by writing and lecturing. Then they have to decide themselves what to do.
In 20 years, do you expect changes in how we view heart disease, its causes and treatments?
I am confident that we will see a change in the next few years. There is a growing skepticism among medical scientists. What is happening in Sweden these days may hopefully inspire researchers in other countries to air their skepticism openly.
Recently, experts selected by WHO and FAO published a new report . Here the authors concluded that there was no satisfactory or reliable evidence to support the idea that saturated fat causes heart disease, or diabetes or obesity.
A revolutionary change of direction, you may say. However, they did not change their recommendations!
Together with Kilmer McCully, the discoverer of the association between homocysteine and atherosclerosis, I have presented another hypothesis (You can read that paper in its entirety at this link.)
We think this hypothesis is much more likely because we are able to explain the many observations that do not fit with the present one.  
  Finally, I assume that much of what I have mentioned here may seem incredible, but all the facts, including references to the scientific literature, are available in my new book Fat And Cholesterol Are GOOD For You!

The group's previous recommendation was for routine screenings every year or two for women age 40 and older. They now recommend that before having a mammogram, women ages 40 to 49 should talk to their doctors about the risks and benefits of the test, and then decide if they want to be screened.
While roughly 15 percent of women in their 40’s detect breast cancer through mammography, many other women experience false positives, anxiety, and unnecessary biopsies as a result of the test, according to data.
The Obama administration distanced itself from the new standards, saying government insurance programs would continue to cover routine mammograms for women starting at age 40."

Put Them OUT OF BUSINESS!","The missteps of President Obama’s two FDA appointees - Commissioner Margaret Hamburg and Principal Deputy Commissioner Joshua Sharfstein – could not deviate any further from the President’s stated mission.
President Obama previously explained that ""exposure to mercury leads to serious developmental problems in children. The EPA estimates that every year, more than one in six children could be at risk for developmental disorders.""
Acknowledging that government coziness with industry could inhibit such goals, the president promised to halt the revolving door that permits officials to oscillate between regulatee and regulator. Curiously, FDA's new commissioner, Margaret Hamburg, slipped into office through that revolving door.
Hamburg continued to hold Henry Schein stock options after becoming commissioner. (Henry Schein Inc. is America’s no. 1 seller of mercury amalgam.) Consistent with Obama ethical requirements, she signed a contract limiting her participation in actions affecting Schein while she retained this financial interest.
Then came her first test: a rule to determine warnings for amalgam fillings, products that contain 50 percent mercury but are deceptively marketed to the public as ""silver fillings.""
Skirting the contract she signed, Hamburg worked on the amalgam rule, which now allows amalgam to be sold without disclosing to consumers that it contains mercury.
The FDA even pulled from its consumer Web site a warning that amalgam could cause neurological harm to children and fetuses, burying it on a Web page entitled ""Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff"" - a place no parent will look."
"224","https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/12/03/how-to-prevent-the-flu-easy-as-1-2-3.aspx","March 06, 2019","Is the Flu Vaccine Really ‘Working Well’ This Year?","According to interim estimates1 released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on February 15, 2019 — which uses data from 3,254 adults and children enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network between November 23, 2018, and February 2, 2019 — the overall adjusted effectiveness of the 2018-19 flu vaccine against all influenza virus infection associated with acute respiratory illness (ARI) needing medical attention was 47 percent.
While the media has played this up as ""good news,""2 and the CDC calls the results ""encouraging,""3 the fact of the matter is the vaccine failed to offer any protection more than half of the time, and for adults over 50, it's more or less useless.
This Year's Flu Vaccine Is an Abysmal Failure for Those Over 50
Among children aged 6 months to 17 years, the 2018–19 seasonal flu vaccine had an average effectiveness of 61 percent.4 However, among adults over 50, which is the most vulnerable group, the vaccine had a mere 24 percent effectiveness against all influenza types, and an abysmal 8 percent against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, which was by far the most common type.
According to the CDC, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was responsible for 74 percent of all influenza A infections for which subtype information was available. What's more, the CDC notes that,5 ""Among the 3,254 children and adults with ARI … a total of 465 (14 percent) tested positive for influenza virus by real time RT-PCR …""
In other words, of all the people who came down with acute respiratory illness, only 14 percent actually had confirmed influenza. In the vast majority of cases — 86 percent — their respiratory illness was associated with a viral or bacterial infection caused by something other than a type A or B influenza virus.
This is important to remember, as people have a tendency to jump to the conclusion that when they have influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms they have influenza when, in fact, chances are the majority of the time they don't.
The influenza vaccine contains only three or four type A or B vaccine strain influenza viruses. Even if those vaccine strain viruses are a perfect match for influenza viruses that are circulating in a given flu season, the vaccine does not prevent the majority of other respiratory infections that are experienced by people. As noted by the Cochrane Collaboration:6
""Over 200 viruses cause ILI (influenza-like illness), which produces the same symptoms (fever, headache, aches, pains, cough and runny nose) as influenza. Without laboratory tests, doctors cannot distinguish between ILI and influenza because both last for days and rarely cause serious illness or death.""
The 2017/2018 seasonal influenza vaccine's adjusted overall effectiveness for the U.S. was just 36 percent against influenza A and influenza B virus infection,7,8 and between 2005 and 2015, the flu vaccine's adjusted overall effectiveness was less than 50 percent more than half the time — with a low of only 10 percent in the 2004-05 season.9,10
It's difficult to find another example of where a commercial product can fail to work more than half the time and still be recommended and even mandated for children and adults.
Obesity Is a Major Cause of Influenza Outbreaks and Vulnerability
In related news, research suggests widespread obesity may be a significant contributor to influenza outbreaks and general vulnerability, as obesity makes you shed and transmit virus for a longer period of time, thereby increasing the opportunity for spreading infections to others. According to this study,11 published in the September, 2018 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases:
""[O]besity increases the risk of severe complications and death from influenza virus infection, especially in elderly individuals … Symptomatic obese adults were shown to shed influenza A virus 42 percent longer than nonobese adults … no association was observed with influenza B virus shedding duration. Even among paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic adults, obesity increased the influenza A shedding duration by 104 percent.""
Aubree Gordon, Ph.D., senior author from the University of Michigan School of Public Health, told reporters,12 ""This is the first real evidence that obesity might impact more than just disease severity. It might directly impact transmission as well.""
Additional research is underway to analyze whether influenza virus shed over longer periods is still equally infectious. The answer here, of course, would be to normalize your weight and strengthen your immune function. You can find more information about these strategies in the hyperlinked articles.
Flu Vaccine Still Allows Transmission of Disease
Obesity isn't the only thing that might contribute to influenza outbreaks. A study13 published in the journal PNAS January 18, 2018, found infectious influenza viruses in the exhaled breath of people who had gotten seasonal flu shots and contracted influenza. Those vaccinated two seasons in a row had an even greater viral load of shedding influenza A viruses. According to the authors:
""Self-reported vaccination for the current season was associated with a trend toward higher viral shedding in fine-aerosol samples; vaccination with both the current and previous year's seasonal vaccines, however, was significantly associated with greater fine-aerosol shedding in unadjusted and adjusted models.
In adjusted models, we observed 6.3 times more aerosol shedding among cases with vaccination in the current and previous season compared with having no vaccination in those two seasons … The association of vaccination and shedding was significant for influenza A but not for influenza B infections …
Finding infectious virus in 39 percent of fine-aerosol samples collected during 30 minutes of normal tidal breathing in a large community-based study of confirmed influenza infection clearly establishes that a significant fraction of influenza cases routinely shed infectious virus … into aerosol particles small enough to remain suspended in air and present a risk for airborne transmission …
The association of current and prior year vaccination with increased shedding of influenza A might lead one to speculate that certain types of prior immunity promote lung inflammation, airway closure and aerosol generation …
If confirmed, this observation, together with recent literature suggesting reduced protection with annual vaccination, would have implications for influenza vaccination recommendations and policies.""
Mounting Body of Research Questions Validity of Annual Flu Vaccination as a Public Health Measure
On the whole, there's really very little evidence to suggest annual flu vaccinations are a good way to combat influenza and save lives. On the contrary, the medical literature is burgeoning with studies questioning the validity of this public health measure. For example, studies have shown that:
With each successive annual flu vaccination, the theoretical protection from the vaccine can diminish14 — A 2012 Chinese study15 found a child's chances of contracting a respiratory infection after getting the seasonal flu shot rose more than fourfold, and research published in 2014 concluded that resistance to influenza-related illness in persons over age 9 years in the U.S. was greatest among those who had NOT received a flu shot in the previous five years.16
More recent research suggests the reason seasonal flu shots become less protective with each dose has to do with ""original antigenic sin."" Here, they found that influenza vaccine failed to elicit a strong immune response in most participants,17 which was explained as follows:18
""What's at play seems to be a phenomenon known as 'original antigenic sin.' Flu vaccines are designed to get the immune system to produce antibodies that recognize the specific strains of the virus someone may encounter in a given year.
These antibodies target unique sites on the virus, and latch onto them to disable it. Once the immune system already has antibodies to target a given site on the virus, it preferentially reactivates the same immune cells the next time it encounters the virus. This is efficient for the immune system, but the problem is that the virus changes ever so slightly from year to year.
The site the antibodies recognize could still be there, but it may no longer be the crucial one to neutralize the virus. Antibodies produced from our first encounters with the flu, either from vaccines or infection, tend to take precedence over ones generated by later inoculations. So even when the vaccine is a good match for a given year, if someone has a history with the flu, the immune response to a new vaccine could be less protective.""
71 people have to be vaccinated for a single case of influenza to be avoided, and vaccination has ""little or no appreciable effect on hospitalizations or number of working days lost"" — In its 2014 meta-analysis19 of the available research on inactivated influenza vaccines, the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed evidence related to influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) that people experience during flu seasons, concluding that:
""Injected influenza vaccines probably have a small protective effect against influenza … as 71 people would need to be vaccinated to avoid one influenza case … Vaccination may have little or no appreciable effect on hospitalizations … or number of working days lost.""
The flu vaccine can increase your risk of contracting other, more serious influenza infections — Canadian researchers found that people who had received the seasonal flu vaccine in 2008, on average, had twice the risk of getting sick with the pandemic H1N1 ""swine flu"" in 2009 compared to those who did not receive a flu shot the previous year.20
These findings were replicated in a 2014 ferret study.21 Similarly, a 2009 U.S. study compared health outcomes for children between age 6 months and 18 years who did and did not get annual flu shots and found that children who received influenza vaccinations had a three times' higher risk of influenza-related hospitalization, with asthmatic children at greatest risk.22
The concept of heterologous immunity may account for these findings. Heterologous immunity refers to the concept that your immune system is directional, and that once you've encountered a pathogen, your body is better equipped to fight pathogens that are similar. However, in the case of influenza vaccines, this directionality appears to work against you.
By learning to fend off certain influenza virus strains contained in the vaccine, your immune system becomes less able to fend off other influenza strains and disease-causing pathogens. As noted in a 2014 paper on heterologous immunity:23
""Immunity to previously encountered viruses can alter responses to unrelated pathogens … Heterologous immunity … may be beneficial by boosting protective responses. However, heterologous reactivity can also result in severe immunopathology. The key features that define heterologous immune modulation include alterations in the CD4 and CD8 T cell compartments and changes in viral dynamics and disease progression.""
In other words, while influenza vaccine may offer some level of protection against the three or four viral influenza strains included in the vaccine, depending on whether the vaccine used is trivalent or quadrivalent, it may simultaneously diminish your ability to ward off infection by other influenza strains and types of viral or bacterial infections.
Heterologous immunity is also addressed in a 2013 paper,24 which notes that ""vaccines modulate general resistance,"" and ""have nonspecific effects on the ability of the immune system to handle other pathogens."" Researchers stated that:
""[O]ur current perception of the immune system is … simplistic. It was, to a large extent, shaped in the 1950s with the formulation of the clonal selection hypothesis.
This line of thinking has emphasized the adaptive immune system and the speci<U+FB01>c antigen recognition and speci<U+FB01>c memory, which have been crucial in vaccine development, perhaps at the expense of examining cross-reactive features of the immune system as well as the memory capacity of the innate immune system.
Although tens of thousands of studies assessing disease-speci<U+FB01>c, antibody-inducing effects of vaccines have been conducted, most people have not examined whether vaccines have nonspeci<U+FB01>c effects because current perception excludes such effects.""
Flu vaccine doesn't work well in statin users — Statin drugs may interfere with your immune system's ability to respond to the influenza vaccine.25,26 After vaccination, antibody concentrations were 38 percent to 67 percent lower in statin users over the age of 65, compared to nonstatin users of the same age.27 Antibody concentrations were also reduced in younger people who took statins.
Flu vaccine does not prevent most types of influenza — Independent scientific reviews have also concluded that flu shots have only a ""modest effect in reducing influenza symptoms and working days lost,"" and have no effect on complications of influenza.28,29
Moreover, the influenza vaccine fails to prevent influenza-like illness associated with other types of viruses responsible for about 80 percent of all respiratory or gastrointestinal infections during any given flu season.30,31,32,33,34
Vaccination does not lower mortality in the elderly — Research35 published in 2006 analyzed influenza-related mortality among the elderly population in Italy associated with increased vaccination coverage between 1970 and 2001. Researchers found that after the 1980s, there was no corresponding decline in excess deaths, despite rising vaccine uptake.
According to the authors, ""our study challenges current strategies to best protect the elderly against mortality, warranting the need for better controlled trials with alternative vaccination strategies.""
Another 2006 study36 showed that, even though seniors vaccinated against influenza had a reduced risk of dying during flu season compared to unvaccinated seniors, those who were vaccinated were also even more unlikely to die before the flu season ever started.
This finding has since been attributed to a ""healthy user effect,"" which suggests that older people who get vaccinated against influenza are already healthier and, therefore, less likely to die anyway, whereas those who do not get the shot have suffered a decline in health in recent months.
""New and improved"" flu shot also fails to protect seniors — The Flucelvax vaccine introduced during the 2017-2018 flu season is grown in dog kidney cells rather than chicken eggs. Touted as a new-and-improved flu shot that would protect more people, Food and Drug Administration research found no significant difference between it and the conventional flu shot in protecting seniors.
While flu vaccines overall had a 24 percent effectiveness in preventing flu-related hospitalizations in people aged 65 and older, the Flucelvax vaccine had an effectiveness rate of only 26.5 percent in that population.37
Flu vaccine does not lessen influenza severity — While health officials claim getting a flu shot will lessen your symptoms should you contract influenza, a 2017 study38 by French researchers assessing the veracity of that claim found it to be false. Looking at data from vaccinated and unvaccinated elderly patients diagnosed with influenza, all they found was a reduction in initial headache complaints among those who had been vaccinated. According to the authors:
""Compared to nonvaccinated influenza patients, those who had been vaccinated had a slightly reduced maximum temperature and presented less frequently with myalgia, shivering and headache. In stratified analyses, the observed effect was limited to patients infected with A(H3) or type B viruses.
After adjusting by age group, virus (sub)type and season, the difference remained statistically significant only for headache, which was less frequent among vaccinated individuals.""
Flu vaccine is associated with serious disability — Permanent disability such as paralysis from Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is a risk you need to take into account each time you get a flu shot. As early as 2003, the CDC recognized the flu vaccine causes an excess of 1.7 cases of GBS per 1 million people vaccinated.39
Data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows GBS is the top injury for which people are receiving financial compensation through the federal vaccine injury compensation program (VICP), and the flu vaccine is now the most common vaccine cited by adults seeking a vaccine injury compensation award.40
Shoulder damage is another risk, caused by improper injection technique.41,42,43 Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) includes chronic pain, limited range of motion, nerve damage, frozen shoulder and rotator cuff tears, and is typically the result of the injection being administered too high on the arm. This risk is particularly high when people get vaccinated outside of a doctor's office or other clinical setting.
Many people getting flu shots in a public setting like a grocery store or pharmacy simply roll up their sleeves or pull down the top of their shirt, exposing only the upper part of their deltoid, thereby increasing the risk of getting the injection in the joint space rather than the muscle.
GBS and SIRVA were both added to the Vaccine Injury Table of the VICP in 2017.44,45 By adding those vaccine complications to the table, vaccine-related GBS and SIRVA cases brought before the ""Vaccine Court"" in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., will be more likely to receive federal vaccine injury compensation.
In this lecture, immunologist Tetyana Obukhanych, Ph.D., author of ""Vaccine Illusion: How Vaccination Compromises Our Natural Immunity and What We Can Do to Regain Our Health,"" explains how vaccines damage your immune function, which can result in any number of adverse health effects.

In recent years, pregnant women have been told to get a pertussis-containing Tdap vaccination and an influenza vaccination during each pregnancy.46 According to federal guidelines, the flu shot can be given during any trimester.47 This is irresponsible public health policy, as there's a shocking lack of scientific studies to confirm the safety of that policy for mother and child.48
For starters, drug companies did not test the safety and effectiveness of giving influenza vaccine to pregnant women before the vaccines were licensed in the U.S.,49,50 and data on inflammatory and other biological responses to vaccination during pregnancy that could affect pregnancy and birth outcomes is still lacking.51
As far as the scientific evidence is concerned, it's still unknown whether the influenza vaccine can cause fetal harm or affect your reproductive capacity,52 which is why the vaccine manufacturer product inserts state that the influenza vaccine should only be given to a pregnant woman if it's ""clearly needed.""
Pregnant women are essentially expected to stick to recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and medical trade associations out of sheer faith, since vaccine recommendations are not based on weighty scientific evidence. In fact, health statistics suggest there's something very wrong going on in the U.S., seeing how we have one of the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world.
As of last year, global rates for maternal mortality had fallen by half — except in the U.S., where the number of women who die from pregnancy-related complications has significantly increased.53 Infant mortality rates are also far higher in the U.S. than in any of the other 27 wealthy countries surveilled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).54
Could this be related to the fact that American babies and pregnant women receive the greatest number of vaccines? While there's no research clearly proving this, there's also no evidence to refute the hypothesis that excessive vaccinations may be part of the problem.
While limited, there is at least some evidence that getting the flu vaccine during pregnancy may put that pregnancy at risk. Initial suspicions were raised in 2009, when reports of miscarriage following administration of the H1N1 swine flu vaccine started emerging.55
Dozens of women claimed they lost their babies just hours or days after getting the vaccine, which had not been tested on pregnant women or, if it was, the evidence was never published. Not surprisingly, these instances were passed off as coincidental. After all, miscarriages do happen, and for any number of different reasons.
Then, a CDC-funded study56 published in September 2017, found that women who had received the 2009 pandemic swine flu (pH1N1) vaccine containing influenza shot two years in a row were indeed more likely to suffer miscarriage within the following 28 days.
While most of the miscarriages occurred during the first trimester, several also took place in the second trimester. The median fetal term at the time of miscarriage was seven weeks. In all, 485 pregnant women aged 18 to 44, who had a miscarriage during the flu seasons of 2010/2011 and 2011/2012, were compared to 485 pregnant women who carried their babies to term.
Of the 485 women who miscarried, 17 had been vaccinated twice in a row — once in the 28 days prior to vaccination and once in the previous year. For comparison, of the 485 women who had normal pregnancies, only four had been vaccinated two years in a row. Commenting on the study, which was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Amanda Cohn, CDC adviser for vaccines stated:57
""I think it's really important for women to understand that this is a possible link, and it is a possible link that needs to be studied and needs to be looked at over more [flu] seasons. We need to understand if it's the flu vaccine, or is this a group of women [who received flu vaccines] who were also more likely to have miscarriages.""
Despite those findings, the CDC has not made any changes to its recommendation for pregnant women.
Vitamin D Substantially Outperforms Flu Vaccine
Is the flu vaccine really the most effective way to protect yourself against influenza, despite being less than 50 percent effective overall? Studies have repeatedly demonstrated the excellent track record of vitamin D for preventing respiratory infections.
For example, a 2017 scientific review58 of 25 randomized controlled trials found that vitamin D supplementation cut rates of acute respiratory infections among all participants. Overall, the number needed to treat (NNT) was 33, meaning that for every 33 people taking a vitamin D supplement, one person was spared from acute respiratory infection. (And, remember, the NNT for the flu vaccine preventing a single case of influenza is 71.59)
Among those with severe vitamin D deficiency at baseline, the NNT was 4. Those with blood levels below 10 ng/mL, which is a serious deficiency state, cut their risk of infection by half, while people with higher vitamin D levels reduced their risk by about 10 percent.
According to this international research team, vitamin D supplementation could prevent more than 3.25 million cases of cold and flu each year in the U.K. alone.60 In my view, optimizing your vitamin D levels is one of the absolute best strategies available to prevent respiratory illness of all kinds."

I had such an overwhelming response to the recent video I did on what I eat for breakfast that I decided to expand on the rest of my day. I have actually included the breakfast video above, so if you haven’t yet seen it you can just watch the third video above.
I’d like to share my daily routine with all of you in the hopes you may be able to glean a healthy habit or two, or incorporate some of my lifestyle and fitness tips into your daily life as well.
In My Office
My day begins in my home office, where I spend about several hours checking and answering emails. I then go to exercise in my home gym -- a daily workout is one of my essential health habits that keeps me feeling invigorated all day and gives me more than enough energy to do anything that I need to.
Before I arrive at my work office, I like to get my email Inbox down to zero. This is an important organizational and time-saving strategy for me. As soon as a message hits my Inbox, I respond to it right away, archive it to be checked on later or delete it.
At work I spend much of my day answering emails, making important phone calls, doing interviews and filming videos such as these.
My Daily Supplements
The other component of my morning routine is to take my daily supplements. Each morning, I typically take:
Whole Food Multivitamin Plus Minerals  I take 2-6 of these which has vitamin D, I typically only take this during the winter, as I tend to get plenty of sun exposure in the summer.
Krill Oil: I take 2-4, but usually 2, of these each day to get my supply of high-quality, animal-based omega-3 fats.
Purple Defense: A potent antioxidant.* I also take this when I fly. I use 8 when flying domestically and nine when flying international
Complete Probiotics: For good bacteria.*
Turmeric: A powerful spice that has emerged as one of nature’s most powerful herbs.
Ubiquinol: A reduced form of coenzyme Q10, which is absorbed by your body very effectively.*
A Tour of Our LEED-Certified Office Building
I’m very proud of our office building as it incorporates numerous state-of-the-art components that make it very green. It actually qualifies for LEED green building status.
LEED -- Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design -- is a third party certification program and nationally accepted benchmark stating that a building project is environmentally responsible and a healthy place to live and work.
Along with a very efficient heating and air conditioning system, the building has green furnishings, full-spectrum fluorescent lighting, and shades that assist in heating and cooling and run according to astronomical time.
If you visit our LEED-certified clinic, you will step into a building that enhances your health and wellbeing.
Lunchtime at Work
For optimal health it truly is necessary for either you, someone in your family or someone you hire to spend time in the kitchen preparing fresh, unprocessed, preferably organic and locally grown meals.
Lunchtime can be a particularly challenging time for people to eat healthy; many end up taking up time, gas and money to leave work and grab a bite to eat. Most importantly, many people end up resorting to fast food or other junk foods because they don’t always have the time to prepare a fresh meal.
So I made the decision to hire a chef, for myself personally and also for all of the employees at my Natural Health Center, and it has worked out really well. Our wonderful chef prepares nutritious and healthy meals, which frees up more of my time, and also helps keep our staff well nourished!
A Workout at the Office Gym
I typically work out every day while I’m at home. I do this because I travel quite a bit, and there are times when I travel that my schedule does not allow for exercise. So to make up for those periods I exercise daily when I’m not on the road.
Exercising is one of the most important activities you can do for your health. However, just as your diet, variety is the key. It’s important to vary your exercise routine in order to get the absolute best results.
Your muscles simply get used to the same activity and they require a level of muscle confusion if they are to continue to improve and grow stronger. So my exercise routine contains a variety of activities to cover all the bases, including aerobic, interval, strength training, flexibility and core.
For the cardio days of my workout, I typically do an intense 45-minute session on the elliptical machine, changing my direction forward and backward and drinking plenty of water so I don’t get dehydrated. I also do about 10-15 minutes of flexibility training daily.
On my strength-training days, I like to do a lot of body weight exercises, along with exercises to challenge my balance and work my core muscles. You can view my routine in the second video above.
You’ll notice that most of my exercises use really simple equipment, such as resistance bands, free weights, a weight bench and an exercise ball -- so you can likely find a way to try some of these out in your own home.
Once a week I also work with my personal trainer, who gives me more new ideas to continue the muscle confusion and take my routine to an even higher level.
We are going to be launching a new exercise site soon that will go into far more detail on simple and effective exercises you can use to enhance your health.
This gives you a quick glimpse into my typical day. I hope you will feel compelled to incorporate some of these healthy habits into your own day as you continue on your journey to optimal health."

Dengue fever is a threat to people in more than 100 countries. It is a flu-like disease that produces a high fever, pain in the eyes and joint aches that can last a week.
Dr. Renu Daval-Drager of the World Health Organization says some cases of what is sometimes called ""break bone fever"" can be fatal.
There is no vaccine to prevent dengue and no specific medicine to treat it, so the only defense is eradication of the mosquitoes that carry it and measures to protect people from mosquito bites.
But hope is offered by research being carried out at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio, which relies on very special mice. By infecting these humanized mice with strains of the dengue virus, investigators can study how the disease takes hold and what factors might cause the more serious and often deadly dengue hemorrhagic fever."

What's more, your diet may be crucial to achieving the most desirable complexion.
Using specialist computer software, study participants were asked to manipulate the skin color of male and female Caucasian faces to make them look as healthy as possible. They chose to increase the rosiness, yellowness and brightness of the skin.
Skin that is slightly flushed with blood and full of oxygen suggests a strong heart and lungs, supporting the study's findings that rosier skin appeared healthy. Smokers and people with diabetes or heart disease have fewer blood vessels in their skin, and so skin would appear less rosy.
But the preference for more golden or 'yellow-toned' skin as healthier might be explained by the 'carotenoid pigments' obtained from vegetables in the diet. These plant pigments are powerful antioxidants that soak up dangerous compounds produced when your body combats disease. They are also important for your immune and reproductive systems and may help prevent cancer.
Little or nothing can beat a healthy lifestyle if you want truly gorgeous, glowing skin. Your outside can quite literally mirror your inside in that regard.
Donna Gates, author of The Body Ecology Diet is a great source of helpful advice for optimizing the look and feel of your skin from deep within. She is a walking testimony of the effectiveness of her program as most people mistake her for being twenty years younger than she is.
Truly Clean is More than Skin Deep
By making sure your blood is continuously supplying healthy nutrients to every cell in your body, you can experience radiant, blemish-free skin. This is no easy task in today’s toxic-filled world. But by cleansing these dangerous substances from your body while optimizing your nutrient intake, great skin is still an achievable goal for most.
The good news is that your body is constantly in a cleansing mode and was created with the ability to push out toxins as long as you supply it with the energy to do so.
Eating a healthy diet that is suitable for your nutritional type; focusing on whole, bioavailable organic foods, is your number one strategy for helping your body to detox naturally.
Six Organs That Clean Your Skin From Within
The six organs responsible for providing you with beautiful skin include your:
Liver
Kidneys
Adrenals
Thyroid
Large intestines
Small intestines
Your liver and kidneys are the two organs that filter out impurities on an ongoing basis. If your diet is less than ideal, these two organs can easily become overtaxed.
Sitting on top of your kidneys are your walnut-sized adrenals. Often called the ""workhorses"" of your body, they make many essential hormones including pregnenolone, DHEA, estrogen, progesterone and testosterone.
Healthy hormones are an essential ingredient when seeking energy and beautiful skin. A well-nourished, energetic thyroid also provides hormones and works closely with your adrenals to create energy.
Dry, flakey, sluggish skin is evidence of a weak thyroid.
Your liver, kidneys, adrenals and thyroid are also dependent on the condition of your small and large intestines. These two organs not only provide nutrients to other organs, but they are also responsible for the removal of waste products from your body. When waste meant for elimination remains in your intestines your skin becomes thick, oily and blemished.
Pure, flawless skin is a reflection of clean intestines.
All of the following items will have a negative effect on your inner organs, and therefore need to be avoided if you want clearer, healthier skin:
Drugs and alcohol
Chemicals and heavy metals
Trans fat
Refined, processed table salt
Processed foods
Pasteurized dairy products
Foods that Promote Beautiful Skin
Green foods that promote healthy liver function include chlorella and dark green leafy veggies, such as:
Kale
Spinach
Dandelion greens
Broccoli
Other foods known to contribute to healthy skin include raw and virgin fats and oils. Coconut oil is especially good for your thyroid.
You’ll also want to include plenty of mineral-rich foods (dark green leafy veggies, ocean veggies and seafood) and antioxidant-rich foods (black currants, blueberries) in your diet.
Another group of foods worth mentioning are fermented (or cultured) foods.
Fermented foods help promote the growth of friendly intestinal bacteria and aid in digestion. They also support healthy immune function, including an increase in B vitamins, omega-3, digestive enzymes, lactase and lactic acid, and other immune chemicals that fight off harmful bacteria.
By keeping your insides healthy and clean, your skin will have no choice but follow suit.
That said, I also believe that feeding your skin from the outside with only the best ingredients from nature, can help. This was a major reason for creating my own USDA Certified Organic skin care line.
Again, you’ll want to pay as much attention to the quality and purity of whatever you put on your body as you do with what you put inside it.
Prematurely Aging Skin May Be a Sign of Emotional Stress
In addition to eating a healthy diet, effectively addressing stress is another aspect of maintaining a healthy and youthful-looking face.
Previous research has found that your life experiences, or perhaps more precisely, how you deal with them, have a greater impact on your looks as you age than your genetic makeup.
For example, people who had been through the stress of a divorce looked nearly two years older than their married, single or even widowed twin. Those who used antidepressants also appeared significantly older.
This lends further credence to the emerging and incredibly interesting field of epigenetics, which centers around the notion that environmental factors such as stress and your diet are directly responsible for the expression of your genes.
And it is the expression of your genes -- NOT the genes themselves -- that dictates whether you will develop certain diseases, and how gracefully you may show your age.
So although you may have a genetic “predisposition” for facial wrinkles, for example, you are not necessarily doomed to develop a face full of wrinkles during middle-age.
According to groundbreaking research by the likes of Bruce Lipton, PhD., a forerunner in the field of epigenetics and The New Biology, your genetic expression is ruled by your mind and your emotions. In other words, being able to maintain a more positive outlook can influence the expression of your genes, and thus directly impact how you age.
Previous research has also determined that stress lessens your skin's ability to function properly, and that extended exposure to psychological stress can speed up the aging process of your cells and cause them to die at a faster rate than normal.
In a nutshell, having a healthy, youthful appearance on the outside involves both a healthy diet that supports your internal cleansing mechanisms, and effectively addressing your stress levels.
And both of these factors can have a beneficial impact on the expression of your genes.
The sooner you start to make these positive changes -- to your stress levels, mental outlook and your diet -- the better. Whether you’re young or old, this healthy lifestyle can help maintain a beautiful complexion and keep the signs of aging at bay, or at least slow them down considerably."

Nigeria and many other nations use an oral polio vaccine because it's cheaper, easier, and protects entire communities. But it's made from a live polio virus which carries a risk of causing polio. In even rarer instances, the virus in the vaccine can mutate into a deadlier version that ignites new outbreaks. Genetic analysis has proven that such mutated viruses have caused at least seven separate outbreaks in Nigeria."

Click below to read eight more cutting-edge vitamin D research papers.
Vitamin D is one of my favorite topics to share valuable information about, as the research that continues to come out is just so exciting.
If you click on the link you will be taken to a site that allows you to download the PowerPoint presentations of an awesome vitamin D conference. I had actually planned on attending this conference in Toronto in early November but had a schedule conflict that prevented me from attending at the last minute.
The evidence is overwhelming, and the solution is incredibly simple. One way to drastically reduce your risk of cancer and countless other chronic diseases is to optimize your levels of vitamin D -- either by safe sun exposure, tanning in a safe tanning bed or taking a high-quality supplement.
Yet, a great deal of people around the world have heard nothing of this great “discovery.” It’s even likely that your doctor is among them.
And on top of that, many, many people are deficient in vitamin D. It’s thought that over 95 percent of U.S. senior citizens may be deficient, along with 85 percent of the American public.
Clearly, the word needs to get out but the mainstream media is slow to react.
Plus, there’s no money to be made on selling vitamin D (it’s one of the most inexpensive supplements around, and sun exposure is free!). So don’t count on any major corporations or drug companies to help get the message out (rather, count on them to try and suppress this lifesaving information).
The longer this information goes largely unnoticed, the more people will die unnecessarily from potentially preventable cancers and other diseases.
So just what do you stand to gain from optimizing your vitamin D? Well, I highly recommend browsing through the studies above to see it with your own eyes, but let me summarize some of the amazing benefits here.
Vitamin D is a Powerful Cancer Prevention Strategy
Theories linking vitamin D to certain cancers have been tested and confirmed in more than 200 epidemiological studies, and understanding of its physiological basis stems from more than 2,500 laboratory studies, according to epidemiologist Cedric Garland, DrPH, professor of family and preventive medicine at the UC San Diego School of Medicine.
Dr. Garland’s findings only lend further credence to the mountain of growing evidence that optimal levels of vitamin D are essential for your health. Here are just a few highlights into some of the most noteworthy findings:
Some 600,000 cases of breast and colorectal cancers could be prevented each year if vitamin D levels among populations worldwide were increased, according to previous research by Dr. Garland and colleagues. And that’s just counting the death toll for two types of cancer.
Optimizing your vitamin D levels could help you to prevent at least 16 different types of cancer including pancreatic, lung, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancers.
A large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled study on vitamin D and cancer showed that vitamin D can cut overall cancer risk by as much as 60 percent! This was such groundbreaking news that the Canadian Cancer Society has actually begun endorsing the vitamin as a cancer-prevention therapy.
Light-skinned women who had high amounts of long-term sun exposure had half the risk of developing advanced breast cancer (cancer that spreads beyond your breast) as women with lower amounts of regular sun exposure, according to a study in the American Journal of Epidemiology.
A study by Dr. William Grant, Ph.D., internationally recognized research scientist and vitamin D expert, found that about 30 percent of cancer deaths -- which amounts to 2 million worldwide and 200,000 in the United States -- could be prevented each year with higher levels of vitamin D.
Now we’re starting to see more evidence that the type of cancer in question may not be all that important, because vitamin D appears to play a key role in the development-- and prevention -- of ALL types of cancer!
Beyond cancer, researchers have pointed out that increasing levels of vitamin D could prevent diseases that claim nearly 1 million lives throughout the world each year!
Vitamin D Drastically Lowers Your Risk of Heart Disease
Low levels of vitamin D in your blood have long been correlated with higher risk of heart disease and heart attacks, and a previous study found women who take vitamin D supplements lower their risk of death from heart disease by one-third.
Further, low levels of vitamin D are known to nearly double the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes.
It’s also been suggested that the more sunlight you get, the better your cardiovascular health will be, as there are a number of physiological mechanisms triggered by vitamin D production through sunlight exposure that act to fight heart disease, such as:
An increase in your body's natural anti-inflammatory cytokines
The suppression of vascular calcificatio
The inhibition of vascular smooth muscle growth
Vitamin D Can Boost Your Health All Around
Vitamin D is not “just a vitamin,” but rather the only known substrate for a potent, pleiotropic (meaning it produces multiple effects), repair and maintenance seco-steroid hormone that serves multiple gene-regulatory functions in your body.
There are only 30,000 genes in your body and vitamin D has been shown to influence about 3,000 of them. Receptors that respond to the vitamin have been found in almost every type of human cell, from your brain to your bones. And researchers keep finding health benefits from vitamin D in virtually every area they look.
Can vitamin D fight colds and the flu? Yes!
Help prevent obesity? It sure can.
Tackle depression, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis? Yes, yes and yes!
It is estimated that 25 to 50 percent of any health care budget could be saved with adequate vitamin D serum levels.
How Much Vitamin D Do You Need?
The best way to optimize your vitamin D is through safe sun exposure, or alternatively using a safe tanning bed. It is frequently possible to generate about 20,000 units of vitamin D by exposing your skin to the sun.
However, if you do not have access to regular sun exposure on a large portion of your bare skin, a vitamin D3 supplement may be necessary.
Based on the most recent research, the current recommendation for dosage is 35 IU’s of vitamin D per pound of body weight.
So for a child weighing 40 pounds, the recommended average dose would be 1,400 IU’s daily, and for a 170-pound adult, the dose would be nearly 6,000 IU’s.
However, it’s important to realize that vitamin D requirements are highly individual, as your vitamin D status is dependent on numerous factors, such as the color of your skin, your location, and how much sunshine you’re exposed to on a regular basis.
So, although these recommendations may put you closer to the ballpark of what most people likely need, it is simply impossible to make a blanket recommendation that will cover everyone’s needs.
The only way to determine the correct dose is to get your blood tested since there are so many variables that influence your vitamin D status.
I recommend using Lab Corp in the U.S. 

Getting the correct test is the first step in this process, as there are TWO vitamin D tests currently being offered: 1,25(OH)D, and 25(OH)D.
The correct test your doctor needs to order is 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is the better marker of overall D status. This is the marker that is most strongly associated with overall health.
Next, the “normal” 25-hydroxyvitamin D lab range is between 20-56 ng/ml. As you can see in the chart below, this conventional range is really a sign of deficiency, and is too broad to be ideal.
In fact, your vitamin D level should never be below 32 ng/ml, and any levels below 20 ng/ml are considered serious deficiency states, increasing your risk of as many as 16 different cancers and autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, just to name a few.
The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 50-65 ng/ml.
This range applies for everyone; children, adolescents, adults and seniors.
These ranges are based on healthy people in tropical or subtropical parts of the world, where they are receiving healthy sun exposures. It seems more than reasonable to assume that these values are in fact reflective of an optimal human requirement.
Keeping your level in this range, and even erring toward the higher numbers in this range, is going to give you the most protective benefit. And the way you maintain your levels within this range is by getting tested regularly -- say two to four times a year in the beginning, and adjusting your vitamin D intake accordingly.
The D*Action Project: How YOU Can Make a Difference and Spread the Word About Vitamin D
GrassrootsHealth has launched a worldwide public health campaign to solve the vitamin D deficiency epidemic in a year through a focus on testing and education with all individuals spreading the word.
And you are all invited to join in this campaign!
With Dr. Garland at the helm, The D*Action Project will be monitoring, for five years, the health outcomes of individuals who get their vitamin D levels to the levels of 40-60 ng/ml. I would highly recommend that you optimize your levels to the high end of this spectrum, as optimal vitamin D levels are 50-65 ng/ml, or 65-90 ng/ml if you are treating cancer.
Says Carole Baggerly, director of GrassrootsHealth:
""We will be tracking the incidence of many diseases, from cancer to diabetes and muscular function as well as pain levels to see what effect the higher vitamin D levels may have.
We expect to see a significant reduction in the incidence of breast cancer (and its recurrence), colon cancer, diabetes and myocardial infarction, compared with the general population. With the expansion of the project by individuals, we could substantially reduce this epidemic in a few years!”
So how can you get involved? Join the D*action Project!
Simply complete a health questionnaire and test your vitamin D levels two times per year during the 5-year program to help demonstrate the public health impact of this nutrient.
GrassrootsHealth is sponsoring the use of blood spot test kits (laboratory analysis done by ZRT Labs) for a $40 fee to each individual. The tests are to be done twice a year by each individual along with the submission of some basic health data. The fee includes:
A vitamin D blood spot test kit to be used at home (except in the state of New York)
The results are sent directly to you
You will be asked to take a quick health survey and also to take action to adjust your vitamin D levels to get into the desired ranges, ideally in consultation with a knowledgeable health care professional.
If you are a physician, medical institution or other health group, please also get involved by contacting Baggerly directly at: carole@grassrootshealth.org. Baggerly was also instrumental in getting Canada to investigate the use of vitamin D against the swine flu.
The information you provide in the health survey will then be used in a five-year study to evaluate the results of the program in disease prevention, and to help create a long-term plan for public health.
This project depends on a true ‘grassroots’ health movement. Together we can stop the vitamin D deficiency epidemic in its tracks and improve the health of millions of people.
With only 100 of you joining today, and getting two friends to join in two weeks (and those two friends getting two more), by week 42 there could be 400,000,000 people who are vitamin D ‘replete’ (more than the United States population)!
